# Sampling

## Population vs Sample

A population is the full group we want to understand.  
A sample is a smaller, representative subset used to infer population behavior.

Sampling allows us to study *a few* to understand *the many*.


## Why Not Measure Everyone?

Measuring every individual is often:

- Too expensive  
- Too slow  
- Logistically impossible  
- Sometimes destructive  

A properly selected sample provides reliable insight with far less effort.

## Why Businesses Prefer Sampling

Sampling helps organizations:

- Reduce cost and effort  
- Make faster decisions  
- Handle large, continuous data streams  
- Avoid unnecessary measurements  

Sampling is a **scientific tool**, not a shortcut.

## Risks of Sampling

Sampling introduces uncertainty because sample values rarely match population values.

- Larger samples reduce error  
- Good design prevents bias  
- Statistics helps quantify uncertainty  


## Types of Sampling

Two major families:

- **Probability sampling:** known chance of selection  
- **Non-probability sampling:** selection probability unknown  

We focus mainly on probability-based methods.


## Simple Random Sampling

Every population member has an equal chance of selection.

![Simple Random](../../../img/statistics/simple_random_sampling.png)



## Systematic Sampling | 1

Select every **k-th** member of a population list.

The sampling constant:

$$
k = \frac{N}{n}
$$

where  
- **N:** population size  
- **n:** sample size  


![Systematic](../../../img/statistics/systematic_sampling.png)

## Systematic Sampling | 2

Systematic sampling is easier to implement than a pure random sample.

**Risk:**  
If the population has a repeating pattern aligned with $k$, bias may occur.

**Fix:**  
Randomize the **starting point** before selecting every k-th observation.



## Stratified Sampling | 1

Used when population subgroups differ in ways **important to the analysis**.  
The population is divided into **strata**, and each stratum is sampled proportionally.

This prevents **over- or under-representation**, especially when natural differences exist (e.g., junior vs senior engineers).

![Stratified](../../../img/statistics/stratified_sampling.png)

## Stratified Sampling | 2

Example proportional allocation (sample size 200):

| Stratum | Population | Pop % | Sample | Calculation |
|--------|------------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Junior | 1200 | 40% | 80 | $0.40 \times 200$ |
| Mid-Level | 900 | 30% | 60 | $0.30 \times 200$ |
| Senior | 450 | 15% | 30 | $0.15 \times 200$ |
| Management | 450 | 15% | 30 | $0.15 \times 200$ |
| **Total** | **3000** | **100%** | **200** | — |



## Cluster Sampling | 1

Cluster sampling divides the population into **heterogeneous groups** called clusters.  
Instead of sampling individuals from the full list, entire clusters are selected, and data are collected from all units (or a subsample) inside each cluster.

Typical clusters: classrooms, neighborhoods, branch offices, cities.

**Stratified vs Cluster**

- **Strata** are homogeneous (e.g., only juniors).  
- **Clusters** are mini-populations,

## Bootstrap Resampling

Resampling **with replacement** to estimate:

- Variability  
- Standard errors  
- Confidence around model metrics  

Does not require strict distributional assumptions.

## Non-Probability Sampling

Used when probability-based design is not possible.

- **Convenience sampling:** choose whoever is easiest to reach  
- **Internet polls:** fast but biased  
- Not reliable for inference or population estimates


## Sampling Error vs Non-Sampling Error

**Sampling Error:**  
Difference between sample statistic and true parameter:

$$
\text{Sampling Error} = \bar{x} - \mu
$$

**Non-Sampling Error:**  
Survey bias, measurement mistakes, data entry errors, non-response issues.  
Cannot be fixed by increasing sample size.


## Finite Population Correction

When sampling more than 5% of a finite population:

$$
\sigma_{\bar{x}}
=
\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
\sqrt{\frac{N - n}{N - 1}}
$$

Accounts for reduced variability when sampling without replacement.
  
# Confidence Intervals

## Introduction

One of the most important roles statistics plays is to:

- gather information from a sample
- use that information to make statements about a population
- quantify uncertainty `with` confidence intervals

Confidence intervals help measure how certain we are about population parameters based 1 sample data.


## Point Estimates

A point estimate is a single value used to estimate a population parameter.

Common point estimates:

- sample mean $\bar{x}$
- sample proportion $\hat{p}$

Point estimates are easy to compute but do not show uncertainty.
They provide only a single best guess of the true population value.


## Finite Population Correction

When sampling more than 5% of a finite population:

$$
\sigma_{\bar{x}} =
\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
\sqrt{\frac{N - n}{N - 1}}
$$

This correction adjusts the standard error to reflect reduced variability when sampling without replacement.
