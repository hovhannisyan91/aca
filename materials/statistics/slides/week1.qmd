## Overview

This chapter introduces the foundations of data analytics and statistical thinking.  
Students explore how data becomes insight, what types of analytics exist, and how organizations move through the data lifecycle—from collection to decision-making.  

>By the end of the class, you should be able to describe what data analytics is, recognize the main forms of analytics, and identify how data-related roles interact within a company.

## What Is Data Analytics? {.smaller}

Data analytics is the practice of examining data systematically to discover useful information, reach conclusions, and support decision-making.  
In practice, it bridges raw data and business strategy. The process typically follows five stages:

1. **Data Generation** – transactions, sensors, user interactions, or surveys produce raw data.  
2. **Collection and Storage** – data is gathered and kept in databases, data warehouses, or cloud systems.  
3. **Processing and Integration** – data is cleaned, formatted, and connected across sources.  
4. **Analysis and Modeling** – statistical or machine-learning methods reveal patterns and predict outcomes.  
5. **Communication and Action** – visualizations, dashboards, and reports communicate insights for business decisions.

This “data-to-insight” flow is iterative; every analysis generates new questions that feed the next cycle.

## Business Applications of Data Analytics

Analytics supports decision-making across many domains:

- **Telecommunications:** predicting churn, optimizing network performance, or tailoring offers.  
- **Retail:** analyzing baskets, forecasting demand, or optimizing pricing.  
- **Finance:** assessing credit risk or detecting fraud.  
- **Marketing:** evaluating campaign effectiveness and designing experiments (A/B tests).  
- **Healthcare:** identifying risk factors or optimizing treatment outcomes.

The unifying theme is that analytics translates data into value by informing actions.

## Types of Analytics {.smaller}

Different analytical approaches answer different questions.

| Type | Central Question | Typical Methods | Example |
|------|------------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Descriptive** | What happened? | Aggregation, visualization | Monthly sales by region |
| **Diagnostic** | Why did it happen? | Correlation, segmentation | Analyzing the effect of pricing on sales |
| **Predictive** | What might happen? | Regression, classification, forecasting | Predicting churn probability |
| **Prescriptive** | What should we do? | Optimization, simulation | Recommending personalized offers |

## The Data Lifecycle {.smaller}

The data lifecycle describes how information moves through an organization and is transformed into insight.

1. **Capture / Collection:** raw data is obtained from transactional systems, sensors, APIs, or external datasets.  
2. **Storage / Management:** engineers design and maintain databases, warehouses, or data lakes to store data efficiently and securely.  
3. **Processing / Transformation:** data is cleaned, structured, and enriched to prepare it for analysis.  
4. **Analysis / Modeling:** analytical teams explore data, test hypotheses, and build models that explain or predict outcomes.  
5. **Communication / Decision:** results are shared through dashboards, visualizations, and reports to support business actions.

## Professional Roles {.smaller}

| Role | Primary Responsibilities |
|------|---------------------------|
| **Data Engineer** | Builds and maintains the data infrastructure, pipelines, and integrations that collect and store raw data. |
| **Analytics Engineer** | Bridges engineering and analysis by transforming raw data into clean, documented, and reusable datasets—often using SQL, dbt, and data-modeling best practices. Ensures analysts and data scientists can work efficiently with trustworthy, well-structured data. |
| **Data Analyst** | Explores datasets, performs aggregations, builds dashboards, and answers business questions through descriptive and diagnostic analysis. |
| **Business Analyst** | The business analyst plays a similar role to the data analyst while bringing domain-specific knowledge to their work. A financial analyst, for example, is a type of business analyst who specializes in working with data from the finance industry.|
| **Data Scientist** | Applies statistical and machine-learning techniques to uncover patterns, generate predictions, and perform experimentation. |
| **Business Stakeholder / Manager** | Interprets and acts on insights, ensuring that data-driven decisions translate into measurable outcomes. |

## Reflection and Discussion

Consider your own organization or a company you know well.

1. What kind of decisions rely on data?  
2. Which type of analytics (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive) is most common today?  
3. Where do you see opportunities for improvement—better data, more automation, or clearer communication?

Write down short notes or share them in the discussion channel for next session.



## Assignment

Choose an industry or organization that interests you and answer:

1. What is a recurring business question that data could help answer?  
2. What data sources would be needed to address it?  
3. Which type of analytics would apply?  
4. Sketch a simple flow diagram describing how data would move from source to insight.

Submit your diagram or short summary before the next class.
