# Agenda

1. Types of Data
2. Central Tendancy measurs
3. Intro to visualization


## What is Statistics?

Statistics is the branch of mathematics that transforms numbers (data) into useful information
fohr decision makers.

**Why learn Statistics?**

1. statistics helps you make better sense of the world.
2. statistics helps you make better business decisions.

The statistical methods you use for these tasks come from one of the two branches of statistics:
*descriptive statistics* and *inferential statistics.*


## Basic Vocabulary of Statistics

- **Variable:** A variable is a characteristic of an item or individual.
- **Data:** Data are the different values associated with a variable.
- **Population:** A population consists of all the items or individuals about which you want to
reach conclusions.
- **Sample:** A sample is the portion of a population selected for analysis.
- **Parameter:** A parameter is a measure that describes a characteristic of a population.
- **Statistic:** A statistic is a measure that describes a characteristic of a sample.


# Types of Data

Understanding the **types of data** is the foundation of every analysis or visualization.  
Different data types require different summary statistics, charts, and interpretations.

---

## Why Data Types Matter?

Before calculating averages or plotting charts, it’s essential to recognize what kind of data you’re working with.  
The classification of a variable determines:

- Which **summary statistics** are meaningful  
- Which **visualizations** can be used  
- How relationships between variables should be **interpreted**

---

## Qualitative (Categorical) Data

Qualitative data describe **qualities, categories, or labels** rather than numbers.

| **Subtype** | **Definition** | **Examples** |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Nominal** | Categories with **no natural order** | Gender (Male/Female), City (Paris, Yerevan, Tokyo) |
| **Ordinal** | Categories with a **meaningful order**, but **unequal spacing** | Education Level (High < Bachelor < Master < PhD), Satisfaction (Low–Medium–High) |

> **Remember:**  
> *Nominal* → just names  
> *Ordinal* → names **with rank**

---

## Quantitative (Numerical) Data

Quantitative data represent **measurable quantities** that can be used in arithmetic operations.

| **Subtype** | **Definition** | **Examples** |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Discrete** | Countable numbers, often integers | Number of customers, Complaints per day |
| **Continuous** | Measured values within a range | Temperature, Age, Revenue, Weight |

### Interval Data
Interval values represent **ordered units that have the same difference**.  
A variable is considered interval data when it contains numeric values that are ordered and where the exact differences between values are known.

**Example (Temperature in Celsius):**  

[-15, -10, -5, **0,** 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]

A key limitation of interval data is that it **does not have a true zero**.  
In the Celsius example, there is no such thing as “no temperature.”

### Ratio Data

Ratio values are also **ordered units that have the same difference**, similar to interval values.  
The key distinction is that ratio data **has an absolute zero**.

**Examples:** Income, Weight, Length, etc.


> **Tip:**  
> *Discrete* → counting  
> *Continuous* → measuring

## Additional Data Types (Common in Analytics)

| **Type** | **Definition** | **Example Applications** |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Binary** | Two possible outcomes (Yes/No, 0/1) | Subscription status, churn indicator |
| **Time-Series** | Observations recorded sequentially over time | Daily sales, hourly temperature |
| **Textual / Unstructured** | Words, sentences, or documents | Customer reviews, tweets |
| **Spatial / Geographical** | Location-based information | Store coordinates, delivery zones |

# Measures of Central Tendency

Once we understand our data types, the next step is to summarize them with simple, representative numbers.  
These are called **measures of central tendency**, and they tell us where the “center” of our data lies.

The three most common measures are:

- **Mean or Average** — the average value  
- **Median** — the middle value  
- **Mode** — the most frequent value  

---

## Mean

The **mean** is the sum of all values divided by the number of observations.


$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}
$$


| Example | Calculation |
|----------|--------------|
| Data: 5, 7, 8, 10 | Mean = (5 + 7 + 8 + 10) / 4 = **7.5** |


#### Mean for Sample



$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}
$$


#### Population Mean  
(same, only notation is different)


$$
\mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i}{N}
$$

### Weighted Mean  

| Type      | Score | Weight (%) |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Exam      | 94    | 50         |
| Project   | 92    | 35         |
| Homework  | 100   | 15         |


(*Weights do not need to add up to one!*)

$$
\bar{x} = 
\frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n} (w_i x_i)}
     {\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}
$$


### Sample Mean Example



> **When to Use:**  
> - Conveinent measurement clear to everybody
> - Works well with **continuous or discrete numerical data**.  
> - Sensitive to **outliers** (extreme values can distort the result).

Given the 5 observations:


$$
\bar{x} 
= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_i}{5} 
= \frac{14.2 + 19.6 + 22.7 + 13.1 + 20.9}{5} 
= \frac{90.5}{5}
= 18.1 \
$$


---

$$
\mu
= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_i}{5}
= \frac{300 + 320 + 270 + 210 + 8{,}000}{5}
= \frac{9{,}100}{5}
= 1{,}820
$$

## Median

The **median** is the value that separates the dataset into two equal halves.

**Steps to calculate:**
1. Order the data from smallest to largest.  
2. If the number of observations is odd → middle value.  
3. If even → average of the two middle values.

| Example | Calculation |
|----------|--------------|
| Data: 2, 5, 7, 9, 12 | Median = 7 |
| Data: 3, 5, 8, 10 | Median = (5 + 8)/2 = **6.5** |

> **When to Use:**  
> - Better than the mean for **skewed data** or when **outliers** are present.  
> - Common for **income, property prices**, etc.

---

## Mode

The **mode** is the value that appears most often.

| Example | Calculation |
|----------|--------------|
| Data: 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 7 | Mode = **5** |

> **When to Use:**  
> - Ideal for **categorical or discrete data**.  
> - A dataset can have:
>   - **One mode** → unimodal  
>   - **Two modes** → bimodal  
>   - **More than two** → multimodal

---

## Comparison of Mean, Median, and Mode

| **Measure** | **Best For** | **Sensitive to Outliers?** | **Data Type** | **Example Context** |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Mean** | Symmetrical distributions | Yes | Continuous, Discrete | Average income |
| **Median** | Skewed distributions | No | Continuous | Typical housing price |
| **Mode** | Categorical / Repeated values | No | Nominal, Ordinal | Most common product category |

> **Visual Insight:**  
> In a **perfectly symmetrical** distribution → Mean = Median = Mode  
> In a **right-skewed** distribution → Mean > Median > Mode  
> In a **left-skewed** distribution → Mean < Median < Mode


## Frequency Distributions

### Symmetric Distribution {.smaller}

Mean ~ Median

```{python}
#| echo: false
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

np.random.seed(1)

# Normal (symmetric) distribution
data_sym = np.random.normal(loc=50, scale=10, size=500)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7,4))
ax.hist(data_sym, bins=20, edgecolor="black", alpha=0.7)
ax.set_title("Symmetric Distribution (Mean ≈ Median)")
ax.set_xlabel("Value")
ax.set_ylabel("Frequency")

plt.show()
```


### Left Skewed Distributions

```{python}
#| echo: false
# Left-skewed using a reversed gamma distribution
data_left = 100 - np.random.gamma(shape=5, scale=4, size=500)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7,4))
ax.hist(data_left, bins=20, edgecolor="black", alpha=0.7)
ax.set_title("Left-Skewed Distribution (Mean < Median)")
ax.set_xlabel("Value")
ax.set_ylabel("Frequency")

plt.show()
```
