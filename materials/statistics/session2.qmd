# Types of Data

Understanding the **types of data** is the foundation of every analysis or visualization.  
Different data types require different summary statistics, charts, and interpretations.

---

## Why Data Types Matter

Before calculating averages or plotting charts, it’s essential to recognize what kind of data you’re working with.  
The classification of a variable determines:

- Which **summary statistics** are meaningful  
- Which **visualizations** can be used  
- How relationships between variables should be **interpreted**

---

## Qualitative (Categorical) Data

Qualitative data describe **qualities, categories, or labels** rather than numbers.

| **Subtype** | **Definition** | **Examples** |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Nominal** | Categories with **no natural order** | Gender (Male/Female), City (Paris, Yerevan, Tokyo) |
| **Ordinal** | Categories with a **meaningful order**, but **unequal spacing** | Education Level (High < Bachelor < Master < PhD), Satisfaction (Low–Medium–High) |

> **Remember:**  
> *Nominal* → just names  
> *Ordinal* → names **with rank**

---

## Quantitative (Numerical) Data

Quantitative data represent **measurable quantities** that can be used in arithmetic operations.

| **Subtype** | **Definition** | **Examples** |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Discrete** | Countable numbers, often integers | Number of customers, Complaints per day |
| **Continuous** | Measured values within a range | Temperature, Age, Revenue, Weight |

> **Tip:**  
> *Discrete* → counting  
> *Continuous* → measuring

---

## Additional Data Types (Common in Analytics)

| **Type** | **Definition** | **Example Applications** |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Binary** | Two possible outcomes (Yes/No, 0/1) | Subscription status, churn indicator |
| **Time-Series** | Observations recorded sequentially over time | Daily sales, hourly temperature |
| **Textual / Unstructured** | Words, sentences, or documents | Customer reviews, tweets |
| **Spatial / Geographical** | Location-based information | Store coordinates, delivery zones |

# Measures of Central Tendency

Once we understand our data types, the next step is to summarize them with simple, representative numbers.  
These are called **measures of central tendency**, and they tell us where the “center” of our data lies.

The three most common measures are:

- **Mean** — the average value  
- **Median** — the middle value  
- **Mode** — the most frequent value  

---

## Mean

The **mean** is the sum of all values divided by the number of observations.

\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}
\]

| Example | Calculation |
|----------|--------------|
| Data: 5, 7, 8, 10 | Mean = (5 + 7 + 8 + 10) / 4 = **7.5** |

> **When to Use:**  
> - Works well with **continuous or discrete numerical data**.  
> - Sensitive to **outliers** (extreme values can distort the result).

---

## Median

The **median** is the value that separates the dataset into two equal halves.

**Steps to calculate:**
1. Order the data from smallest to largest.  
2. If the number of observations is odd → middle value.  
3. If even → average of the two middle values.

| Example | Calculation |
|----------|--------------|
| Data: 2, 5, 7, 9, 12 | Median = 7 |
| Data: 3, 5, 8, 10 | Median = (5 + 8)/2 = **6.5** |

> **When to Use:**  
> - Better than the mean for **skewed data** or when **outliers** are present.  
> - Common for **income, property prices**, etc.

---

## Mode

The **mode** is the value that appears most often.

| Example | Calculation |
|----------|--------------|
| Data: 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 7 | Mode = **5** |

> **When to Use:**  
> - Ideal for **categorical or discrete data**.  
> - A dataset can have:
>   - **One mode** → unimodal  
>   - **Two modes** → bimodal  
>   - **More than two** → multimodal

---

## Comparison of Mean, Median, and Mode

| **Measure** | **Best For** | **Sensitive to Outliers?** | **Data Type** | **Example Context** |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Mean** | Symmetrical distributions | Yes | Continuous, Discrete | Average income |
| **Median** | Skewed distributions | No | Continuous | Typical housing price |
| **Mode** | Categorical / Repeated values | No | Nominal, Ordinal | Most common product category |

> **Visual Insight:**  
> In a **perfectly symmetrical** distribution → Mean = Median = Mode  
> In a **right-skewed** distribution → Mean > Median > Mode  
> In a **left-skewed** distribution → Mean < Median < Mode
