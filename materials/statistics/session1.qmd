## Overview

This chapter introduces the foundations of data analytics and statistical thinking.  
Students explore how data becomes insight, what types of analytics exist, and how organizations move through the data lifecycle—from collection to decision-making.  

>By the end of the class, you should be able to describe what data analytics is, recognize the main forms of analytics, and identify how data-related roles interact within a company.

---

## What Is Data Analytics?

Data analytics is the practice of examining data systematically to discover useful information, reach conclusions, and support decision-making.  
In practice, it bridges raw data and business strategy. The process typically follows five stages:

1. **Data Generation** – transactions, sensors, user interactions, or surveys produce raw data.  
2. **Collection and Storage** – data is gathered and kept in databases, data warehouses, or cloud systems.  
3. **Processing and Integration** – data is cleaned, formatted, and connected across sources.  
4. **Analysis and Modeling** – statistical or machine-learning methods reveal patterns and predict outcomes.  
5. **Communication and Action** – visualizations, dashboards, and reports communicate insights for business decisions.

This “data-to-insight” flow is iterative; every analysis generates new questions that feed the next cycle.

---

## Business Applications of Data Analytics

Analytics supports decision-making across many domains:

- **Telecommunications:** predicting churn, optimizing network performance, or tailoring offers.  
- **Retail:** analyzing baskets, forecasting demand, or optimizing pricing.  
- **Finance:** assessing credit risk or detecting fraud.  
- **Marketing:** evaluating campaign effectiveness and designing experiments (A/B tests).  
- **Healthcare:** identifying risk factors or optimizing treatment outcomes.

The unifying theme is that analytics translates data into value by informing actions.

---

## Types of Analytics

Different analytical approaches answer different questions.

| Type | Central Question | Typical Methods | Example |
|------|------------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Descriptive** | What happened? | Aggregation, visualization | Monthly sales by region |
| **Diagnostic** | Why did it happen? | Correlation, segmentation | Analyzing the effect of pricing on sales |
| **Predictive** | What might happen? | Regression, classification, forecasting | Predicting churn probability |
| **Prescriptive** | What should we do? | Optimization, simulation | Recommending personalized offers |

## The Data Lifecycle and Professional Roles

The data lifecycle describes how information moves through an organization and is transformed into insight.

1. **Capture / Collection:** raw data is obtained from transactional systems, sensors, APIs, or external datasets.  
2. **Storage / Management:** engineers design and maintain databases, warehouses, or data lakes to store data efficiently and securely.  
3. **Processing / Transformation:** data is cleaned, structured, and enriched to prepare it for analysis.  
4. **Analysis / Modeling:** analytical teams explore data, test hypotheses, and build models that explain or predict outcomes.  
5. **Communication / Decision:** results are shared through dashboards, visualizations, and reports to support business actions.

| Role | Primary Responsibilities |
|------|---------------------------|
| **Data Engineer** | Builds and maintains the data infrastructure, pipelines, and integrations that collect and store raw data. |
| **Analytics Engineer** | Bridges engineering and analysis by transforming raw data into clean, documented, and reusable datasets—often using SQL, dbt, and data-modeling best practices. Ensures analysts and data scientists can work efficiently with trustworthy, well-structured data. |
| **Data Analyst** | Explores datasets, performs aggregations, builds dashboards, and answers business questions through descriptive and diagnostic analysis. |
| **Business Analyst** | The business analyst plays a similar role to the data analyst while bringing domain-specific knowledge to their work. A financial analyst, for example, is a type of business analyst who specializes in working with data from the finance industry.|
| **Data Scientist** | Applies statistical and machine-learning techniques to uncover patterns, generate predictions, and perform experimentation. |
| **Business Stakeholder / Manager** | Interprets and acts on insights, ensuring that data-driven decisions translate into measurable outcomes. |

**Each role contributes to a shared goal:** establishing a reliable, end-to-end analytics pipeline that converts data into decisions.

## Reflection and Discussion

Consider your own organization or a company you know well.

1. What kind of decisions rely on data?  
2. Which type of analytics (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive) is most common today?  
3. Where do you see opportunities for improvement—better data, more automation, or clearer communication?

Write down short notes or share them in the discussion channel for next session.

---

## Assignment

Choose an industry or organization that interests you and answer:

1. What is a recurring business question that data could help answer?  
2. What data sources would be needed to address it?  
3. Which type of analytics would apply?  
4. Sketch a simple flow diagram describing how data would move from source to insight.

Submit your diagram or short summary before the next class.

![Connect to xlsx](../../img/tableau/w1_connect_to_datasource.png)

#### Data Types

- Number (Decimal)
- Number (Whole): [Host ID]
- Date: [Host Since]
- Date & Time
- String: [Property Type]
- Geographic Role: [Zip Code]
- Boolean values

#### Dimensions vs Measures

- Dimensions typically contain qualitative values (such as names, dates, or geographical data) and are used to categorize the data.
- Measures are aggregated. Measures typically contain numeric, quantitative values that you can measure. 

#### Discrete vs Continuous

- **Discrete:** individually separate and distinct — `Name`
- **Continuous:** forming an unbroken whole, without interruption — `SUM(Number of Reviews)`

#### Field Types
1. Discrete Dimension: A discrete dimension breaks data into distinct categories. 
2. Discrete Measure: A numerical measure that treated as a set of distinct values.
3. Continuous Dimension: A numeric or date dimension displayed across a continuous axis. 
4. Continuous Measure: The most common type — numeric values shown across a continuous axis.

*Note: Dimensions with a data type of String or Boolean can’t be continuous. Dates are the most common continuous dimension.*

You can convert measures from discrete to continuous or from continuous to discrete. Click the field and choose Discrete or Continuous.

| ![Continuous](../../img/tableau/w1_continuous.png) | ![Discrete](../../img/tableau/w1_descrete.png) |
|:--:|:--:|
| **Continuous** | **Discrete** |

#### Tableau Interface (shelves, marks, filters, dashboards, buttons)
Main sections:
- **A:** Data Pane – contains all fields (dimensions, measures, parameters)
- **B:** Shelves – control how fields appear in your view
- **C:** Marks Card – controls visual elements (color, size, shape, label)
- **D:** Filters Shelf – limits data shown in the view
- **E:** Dashboard Pane – combines multiple sheets into one display
- **F:** Toolbar & Buttons – quick access to tools (undo, redo, sort, etc.)

- **Week 2: Intermediate Visual Analytics**
  - Connect to databases (PostgreSQL)
  - Work with data joins, blends, unions, and relationships
  - Get CSV from SQL Stored Procedure using Python 
  - Dual-axis charts, histograms, boxplots, heatmaps
  - Calculated fields (row-level vs aggregate)  
  - Parameters (interactive filtering) 
  - Types of filters 
  (including dashboard actions)
  - **Task:** Build dashboards with interactivity (actions, filters, tooltips)

#### Work with Data Joins, Blends, Unions, and Relationships

## Relationships

- Links tables **logically** without merging them into a single table.
- Tableau queries tables **only when needed** and manages aggregation automatically.
- Best for **fact and dimension tables** (one-to-many or many-to-many).
- Prevents **row duplication** in aggregated views.

## Join Types

- Combines tables **horizontally** into a single table based on matching keys.
- **Inner Join:** Only rows that exist in **both tables**.
- **Left Join:** All rows from **left table**, matched rows from right, nulls if no match.
- **Right Join:** All rows from **right table**, matched rows from left, nulls if no match.
- **Full Outer Join:** All rows from **both tables**, nulls if no match.
- Can **duplicate rows** in one-to-many relationships.

## Union

- Combines tables **vertically** by stacking rows.
- Requires **matching columns** (extra columns will be null).
- Best for **tables/files with the same schema** (e.g., monthly sales files).
- Increases **row count**, does not merge columns.

## Blend

- Combines data from **different sources** at the **aggregate level**.
- Primary data source drives the view; secondary source provides linked measures/dimensions.
- Can handle **different levels of detail** across sources.
- Useful when joining across **databases or published data sources**.

---

### Data Model

![Data Model](../../img/tableau/w2_data_model.png) 

1. **Logical Layer (Relationships Layer)**  
   - Default view you see first.  
   - Connect tables using relationships — shown as flexible lines: noodles.

2. **Physical Layer (Joins and Unions Layer)**  
   - Each logical table is made up of one or more physical tables.  
   - Combine tables directly using joins or unions.

---

# JOIN vs UNION vs RELATIONSHIP vs BLENDING in Tableau

| Feature / Method           | **UNION** | **JOIN** | **RELATIONSHIP** | **BLEND** |
|-----------------------------|----------|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Layer**                   | Physical Layer | Physical Layer | Logical Layer | Visualization Level |
| **Multiple Data Sources**   | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Merge Tables**            | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Flexibility**             | Static | Static | Flexible | Very Flexible *(Page by Page)* |
| **Join Types**              | n/a | Inner, Left, Right, Full | All | Left |

---

### Notes

- **Union** combines tables **vertically** (adds rows)  
- **Join** combines tables **horizontally** (adds columns)  
- **Relationship** connects logical tables flexibly based on data context  
- **Blending** merges **different data sources** at the visualization level  

### How To Do

| ![Relationship](../../img/tableau/w2_Relationship_Schema.png) | ![Join](../../img/tableau/w2_Join_Schema.png) | ![Union](../../img/tableau/w2_Union.png) |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Relationship | Join | Union |

### Differences in Action

| ![Relationship](../../img/tableau/w2_Relationship.png) | ![Join](../../img/tableau/w2_Join.png) | ![Blend](../../img/tableau/w2_Blend.png) |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Relationship | Join | Blend |

*Note: In joins, the same row can be duplicated multiple times; the SUM of [Order Total] may be inflated.*

---

#### Types of filters

When Tableau applies filters, it follows this logical order:

1. **Extract Filters**
2. **Data Source Filters**
3. **Context Filters**
4. **Dimension Filters**
5. **Measure Filters**

---

## 1. Extract Filters

- **Purpose:** Limit data *before* Tableau loads it into memory.  
- **Example (Orders Dataset):**
  - `Year = 2023` so Tableau only loads 2023 records.  
  - This improves speed and shows only relevant values.

---

## 2. Data Source Filters

- **Purpose:** Restrict data for *all* users of a data source.  
- **Example:**
  - `[Region] = "West"` as a data source filter to limit analysis to western U.S. orders.  
  - When datasource is published, everyone using it will only see West region data.


![Data Source Filter](../../img/tableau/w2_datasource_filter.png)


---

##  3. Context Filters
- **Purpose:** Define the *primary filter* that sets the context for others.  
- **Example:**
  - `[Year] = 2023` as a **context filter**, then filter `[Quarter]`.  
  - Tableau first filters 2023 data, then applies quarter filter (Q1–Q4).  
  - This avoids re-querying the full dataset each time.


| ![Year](../../img/tableau/w2_context_filter.png) | ![Quarter](../../img/tableau/w2_context_filter1.png) | 
|:--:|:--:|
| Year | Quarter |

---

## 4. Dimension Filters

- **Purpose:** Filter categorical fields like Region, Product Category, or Customer Name.  
- **Examples:** 
- Filter by `[Region] = "West"`.
- Filter by `[Customer name]`

---

## 5. Measure Filters

- **Purpose:** Filter numerical fields like `OrderTotal`, `Quantity`, `Unite Price` or `Discount`.  
- **Examples:**
  - Filter `[Unite Price] >= 100` to analyze only high-value purchases.  

![Measure filter](../../img/tableau/w2_measure_filter.png)
  
---

## 6. Date Filters

- **Purpose:** Limit by specific dates or dynamic time ranges.  
- **Examples:**
  - Show only orders from the **last quarter** → `[OrderDate] → Relative Date → Last 1 Quarter`.  
  - View all orders **between Jan 1 and Mar 31, 2023**.  
  - Compare **Q1 vs Q2 2023** in a dashboard using a filter action.

![Date filter](../../img/tableau/w2_date_filter.png)

---

## 7. Top N Filters

- **Purpose:** Display only the top or bottom performers based on a measure.  
- **Examples:**
  - **Top 10 Customers by Count(Order_ID)**  
  - **Bottom 5 Products by Quantity Sold**
- **Tableau Action:**
  - Right-click `[CustomerName]` → Filter → *Top* → “By field” → `Count(Order_ID)` → Top 10.

![Top N filter](../../img/tableau/w2_top_n_filter.png)

---

## 8. Interactive (Quick) Filters

- **Purpose:** Give users control to filter in dashboards.  
- **Example:**
  - Right-click `Quarter([OrderDate])` → *Show Filter* → choose “Dropdown” or “Single Value List.”  
  - In your dashboard, users can dynamically select “Q1” or “Q2” to update charts.

  ![Interactive filter](../../img/tableau/w2_show_filter.png)

---

#### Calculated Fields (Row-Level vs Aggregate)


Calculated fields allow you to create new data fields in Tableau using formulas.  
They are useful for comparisons, ratios, flags, or categorization.

There are two main types of calculated fields in Tableau.

---

# Calculated Fields (Row-Level vs Aggregate)

---

## Row-Level Calculations
- Performed **for each individual record (row)** in the data source.  
- Results are calculated **before aggregation**.  
- **Example:**
  `[Profit per Order] = [Sales] - [Cost]

## Aggregate Calculations

- Performed **after data is aggregated** in the view.  
- Aggregations such as `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` must be applied.  
- **Example:**
  `[Profit] = SUM([Sales]) - SUM([Cost])


---

- **Week 4: Dashboard Design & Performance**
  - Visual storytelling principles
  - Color theory fundamentals
  - Best practices for dashboard design
  - Types of dashboards (Executive, Operational, Analytical, Strategic, Self-Service)  
  - Interactive dashboards (Filters, Parameters, Highlights, Actions)

  - **Task:** Build an end-to-end business dashboard  
    - Add filters, parameters, and highlights  
    - Include interactivity using URL actions and sheet swapping

## Visual Storytelling Principlse

### The Role of Edward Tufte in Visual Storytelling

In the field of **visual storytelling**, **Edward R. Tufte** holds a *highly valued and foundational role*.  
His work bridges **data, design, and narrative**, showing how information can be communicated not just clearly — but beautifully.  
Tufte’s philosophy inspires designers, analysts, and artists to transform raw data into meaningful visual stories that both **inform and move** audiences.

---

## Who is Edward Tufte?

**Edward R. Tufte** is an American statistician, artist, and Yale professor, often referred to as the **father of data visualization**.  
He teaches that visual storytelling should combine **truth, clarity, and design integrity** — allowing the story within data to emerge naturally.

> “Above all else, show the data.”

### His most influential books

- *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*  
- *Envisioning Information*  
- *Beautiful Evidence*  

Tufte’s principles are not about decoration but **purposeful simplicity** — every mark, color, or shape should tell part of the story.

---

## 1️⃣ Storytelling with Data: Minard’s Map of the 1812 Russian Campaign

![Minard’s Map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Minard.png)

**What it shows:**  

Charles Joseph Minard’s famous visualization tells the tragic story of **Napoleon’s march to Moscow**

- The **width of the band** represents the army size at each stage.  
- The **path** shows direction and geography.  
- The **line below** depicts temperatures during the retreat.  
Together, these layers merge **six data variables** into one coherent visual narrative.  
*(Sources: [closeread.dev](https://closeread.dev), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard))*  

**Why it matters:**  

- Demonstrates that data can convey human emotion and tragedy.  
- Embodies Tufte’s core message: *“Above all else, show the data.”*  
- Combines **clarity, precision, and storytelling depth**.  
*(Reference: [Luís Cruz](https://luiscruz.github.io))*  

**Storytelling takeaway:**  
A single visual can tell a *complete story* — if every element is meaningful.

---

## 2️⃣ Avoid “Chartjunk” — Keep the Story Clear

![Chartjunk Example](https://www.brightcarbon.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Image3-1.jpg)

**What is chartjunk?**  
Unnecessary decorative elements (3D bars, shadows, clip art, heavy borders) that distract from meaning.  

**Why it matters in storytelling:**  
Visual noise hides the message. Simplicity reveals it.  

**Guideline:**  
Every pixel, line, and color must serve the **story**, not style.

---

## 3️⃣ Maximize the Data-Ink Ratio — Tell More with Less

![Data-Ink Ratio Example](https://playfairdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Before-and-After-Maximizing-the-Data-Ink-Ratio.png)

**What it means:**  
Every stroke on a chart should represent data, not decoration.  
The *data-ink ratio* measures how efficiently a visualization uses visual space to convey information.  

**Storytelling principle:**  
When visuals are simplified, the **message becomes more powerful**.  

**Practical rules:**  

- Remove redundant labels and borders.  
- Avoid heavy gridlines.  
- Focus attention where the story unfolds.

---

## 4️⃣ Small Multiples — Comparing Stories Side by Side

![Small Multiples Example](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2022/08/12.20.2018_feature.png?w=640)

**What they are:**  
A set of small, consistent visuals that share the same scale and layout.  
They let the viewer **compare patterns** easily and see how a story changes over time or category.  
*(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_multiple))*  

**Why it matters:**  

- Encourages exploration and pattern recognition.  
- Lets your audience see **change and contrast** intuitively.  

**Storytelling takeaway:**  
Use repetition and consistency to guide the audience through multiple connected stories.

---

## 5️⃣ Graphical Integrity — Be Honest in Your Story

![Lie Factor Example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Misusestatistics_0001.png)

**Core idea:**  
A visual should **never distort the truth**.  
If a graph exaggerates or minimizes a change, it tells a false story.  


**To apply:**  

- Keep proportions true to data values.  
- Start axes logically (avoid truncation).  
- Represent differences accurately in size and scale.  

**Storytelling takeaway:**  
Integrity builds credibility — *the story must be as honest as the data itself.*

---

## Following Tufte’s storytelling mindset

- **Focus on the narrative:** Highlight insights, not visuals.  
- **Simplify:** Remove anything that doesn’t support your story.  
- **Use comparison wisely:** Small multiples show progression and contrast.  
- **Be truthful:** Keep scales and proportions accurate.  
- **Add emotion through structure:** Like Minard’s map, weave meaning into data layers (time, geography, value).  

---

## Color Theory Fundamentals

### Color is Deceptive

![Color is Deceptive](../../img/tableau/w4_color1.png)

- How color behaves in relation to other colors and shapes is a complex area of color theory.  
Our eyes and brain adjust for these differences automatically.

- Color perception can be deceptive and is influenced not just by an object’s physical properties but by a variety of other factors, including the light, audience, and surroundings in which a color is viewed
- When designing dashboard's color palette, it is important to consider the context in which the colors will be viewed and the overall goal of the visualization. 
---

## Understanding the Color Wheel

The color wheel serves as a valuable tool for organizing and understanding the relationships between colors. It helps to make effective, harmonious color choices and to create captivating visual compositions.

At its core, the color wheel provides fundamental information about:

- **Primary colors** (red, blue, and yellow)
- **Secondary colors** (green, orange, and violet)
- **Tertiary colors**, which result from combining a primary color with a secondary color

### Color Wheel

![Color wheel](../../img/tableau/w4_color_wheel.png)

Make color palletes based on [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel).

### Primary Colors

Primary colors are the building blocks of all other colors. They cannot be created by mixing other colors.  
The primary colors are typically **red**, **blue**, and **yellow**.

### Secondary Colors

Secondary colors are created by mixing two primary colors together.  
The secondary colors are:

- **Green** (blue + yellow)
- **Orange** (red + yellow)
- **Purple** (blue + red)

### Tertiary Colors

Tertiary colors are formed by mixing a primary color with a neighboring secondary color.  
Examples include **yellow-orange**, **blue-green**, and **red-purple**.  
Tertiary colors provide more variety and subtlety in color palettes.

---

## Respecting Color Relationships and Leveraging Schemes

The **color wheel** provides a visual guide to how colors relate to one another. Understanding these relationships helps create **balanced and visually appealing dashboards**. Depending on the goal — contrast or harmony — choosing the right scheme can enhance both clarity and emotional impact.

### Monochromatic Scheme

![Monochromiatic scheme](../../img/tableau/w4_monochromic_scheme.png)

- Uses **variations of a single hue** (different shades, tints, and tones).  
- Creates a **cohesive, elegant, and subtle** appearance.  
- Ideal for **clean, minimalist designs**.

### Analogous Scheme

![Analogous scheme](../../img/tableau/w4_analogous_scheme.png)

- Combines **colors next to each other** on the color wheel.  
- Produces a **harmonious and calming** effect.  
- Works well for **natural, smooth gradients**.

### Complementary Scheme

![Complementary scheme](../../img/tableau/w4_complementary_scheme.png)

- Uses **colors opposite each other** on the wheel.  
- Provides **high contrast and strong visual energy**.  
- Perfect for **highlighting key metrics or actions**.

### Compound Scheme

![Compound scheme](../../img/tableau/w4_compound_scheme.png)

- Mixes **two or more non-adjacent colors** from the wheel.  
- Creates **balanced contrast** and diverse palettes.  
- Often forms a **rectangle or square** on the color wheel for visual balance.

![Tetradic scheme](../../img/tableau/w4_tetradic_scheme.png)

- Involves **four colors equally spaced** on the color wheel.  
- Produces **vivid, energetic combinations**.  
- Best used carefully to maintain **visual harmony and readability**.

### In addition to the five main color schemes (**Monochromatic**, **Analogous**, **Complementary**, **Compound**, and **Tetradic**), there are a few other important **color harmony schemes** to consider

### Split-Complementary Scheme

- A variation of the complementary scheme.  
- Uses **one base color** and the **two colors adjacent to its complement**.  
- Offers **high contrast** like complementary colors but with **less tension**.  
- Great for dashboards that need vibrancy without visual overload.

### Triadic Scheme

- Uses **three colors evenly spaced** around the color wheel.  
- Creates a **balanced, dynamic, and colorful** look.  
- Works well when you want variety but still want to maintain harmony.  
- Example: Red, Blue, Yellow.

### Neutral Scheme

- Uses **grays, whites, blacks, and muted tones**.  
- Focuses on **simplicity, clarity, and readability**.  
- Ideal for **corporate or analytical dashboards** where data takes center stage.

### Warm and Cool Schemes

- **Warm colors** (reds, oranges, yellows) evoke energy and excitement.  
- **Cool colors** (blues, greens, purples) evoke calm and stability.  
- Can be combined strategically to create **emphasis or emotional tone** in visuals.

## Design Principles

Effective dashboards combine **color harmony, functionality, readability, consistency, and accessibility** to create visuals that are both beautiful and meaningful.  
These principles guide how to select, organize, and apply colors to make dashboards clear, engaging, and easy to interpret.

---

### Color Harmony

Choose colors that **work well together** to create a **balanced and cohesive** design.  
Harmonious palettes enhance the overall visual appeal and make the dashboard feel unified.

---

### Functionality

Use color to **improve usability** and highlight important data.  
Colors should establish **hierarchy, guide attention,** and provide **visual feedback**.  
Each color must be distinct to help users quickly interpret the information.

---

### Readability

Colors should **enhance comprehension** and direct focus without overwhelming users.  
They can create **visual cues** and emphasize trends or key metrics.  

**Example:**  

- **Green** → growth or profit  
- **Red** → loss or decline  

These are known as **semantic colors**, helping users instantly grasp meaning.

---

### Simplicity Through Consistency

Maintain a **limited and consistent color palette**.  
Too many colors create confusion — fewer colors create **clarity, unity, and focus**.  
A simple scheme ensures the dashboard is **visually clean and user-friendly**.

---

### Accessibility

Design for **everyone**, including users with color vision deficiencies.  
Ensure:

- Proper **contrast ratios**  
- Information isn’t conveyed by color alone  
- Palettes are **tested for color blindness** using tools like [Coblis](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/)

Accessible design makes dashboards **inclusive and effective** for all viewers.
