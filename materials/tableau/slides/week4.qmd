## Visual Storytelling Principles

### The Role of Edward Tufte in Visual Storytelling

In the field of **visual storytelling**, **Edward R. Tufte** plays a foundational role.  
His work connects **data, design, and narrative**, showing how information can be communicated not only clearly but also elegantly.

Tufte’s philosophy encourages designers and analysts to transform raw data into visual stories that **inform and move** audiences.

> “Above all else, show the data.”

### Who is Edward Tufte?

**Edward R. Tufte** is an American statistician, artist, and former Yale professor, often called the **father of data visualization**.  
He argues that visual storytelling should combine:

- **Truth** – no distortion of data  
- **Clarity** – no unnecessary complexity  
- **Design integrity** – every element has a purpose  

His most influential books include:

- *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*  
- *Envisioning Information*  
- *Beautiful Evidence*  

Tufte’s principles are not about decoration but **purposeful simplicity** — every mark, color, or shape should tell part of the story.

### 1️⃣ Storytelling with Data: Minard’s Map of the 1812 Russian Campaign

![Minard’s Map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Minard.png)

Charles Joseph Minard’s famous visualization tells the tragic story of **Napoleon’s march to Moscow**:

- The **width of the band** represents the army size at each stage.  
- The **path** shows geographic direction.  
- The **line below** shows temperatures during the retreat.  

Together, these layers merge **six variables** into one coherent narrative.

**Why it matters:**

- Shows that data can convey **emotion and consequence**, not just numbers.  
- Embodies Tufte’s core message: *“Above all else, show the data.”*  
- Demonstrates clarity, precision, and storytelling depth.

**Storytelling takeaway:**  
A single visual can tell a **complete story** — if every element is meaningful.

---

### 2️⃣ Avoid “Chartjunk” — Keep the Story Clear

![Chartjunk Example](https://www.brightcarbon.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Image3-1.jpg)

**Chartjunk** refers to unnecessary decorative elements (3D effects, clip art, heavy borders, textures) that do not add information.

**Why it matters:**

- Visual noise hides the message; simplicity reveals it.  

**Guideline:**  
Every pixel, line, and color must serve the **story**, not style.

---

### 3️⃣ Maximize the Data-Ink Ratio — Tell More with Less

![Data-Ink Ratio Example](https://playfairdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Before-and-After-Maximizing-the-Data-Ink-Ratio.png)

The **data-ink ratio** describes how much of the ink in a chart actually represents data (instead of decoration).

**Storytelling principle:**

- When visuals are simplified, the message becomes more powerful.

**Practical rules:**

- Remove redundant labels and borders.  
- Use subtle gridlines or remove them if they don’t help.  
- Highlight only what matters (e.g., key lines, outliers).

---

### 4️⃣ Small Multiples — Comparing Stories Side by Side

![Small Multiples Example](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2022/08/12.20.2018_feature.png?w=640)

**Small multiples** are sets of similar charts that share the same scale and layout.

**Why they work:**

- Make it easy to **compare patterns** across time, regions, or segments.  
- Encourage exploration without overwhelming the viewer.

**Storytelling takeaway:**  
Use repetition and consistent design to show **change and contrast** across multiple views.

---

### 5️⃣ Graphical Integrity — Be Honest in Your Story

![Lie Factor Example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Misusestatistics_0001.png)

A visualization must **not distort the data**.

**Key practices:**

- Keep proportions true to values (no misleading scaling).  
- Avoid truncated axes that exaggerate small differences (especially on bar charts).  
- Represent differences accurately in height, length, and area.

**Storytelling takeaway:**  
Integrity builds credibility — the story must be as honest as the data.

---

### Tufte’s Mindset in Dashboard Design

- **Focus on the narrative:** Highlight insights, not decoration.  
- **Simplify:** Remove any element that doesn’t support the story.  
- **Use comparison wisely:** Small multiples are powerful for showing change.  
- **Be truthful:** Avoid distortion in axes, scales, and annotations.  
- **Layer context:** Use time, geography, and value together when they clarify the story (like Minard’s map).

---

## Color Theory Fundamentals

### Color is Deceptive

![Color is Deceptive](../../img/tableau/w4_color1.png)

Color perception is **context-dependent**:

- The same color may appear lighter/darker depending on its background.  
- Lighting, screen quality, and surrounding colors influence perception.

When designing dashboard palettes, always consider:

- **Context** (background, other visuals)  
- **Audience** (accessibility, color vision)  
- **Goal** of the visualization (highlight vs neutral tone)

---

### Understanding the Color Wheel

The **color wheel** is a tool for understanding relationships between colors and building harmonious palettes.

It organizes:

- **Primary colors** – red, blue, yellow  
- **Secondary colors** – green, orange, purple  
- **Tertiary colors** – combinations of primary + neighboring secondary (e.g., blue-green)

![Color wheel](../../img/tableau/w4_color_wheel.png)

You can experiment with palettes using tools like the [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel).

---

### Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Colors

- **Primary colors:** Basic building blocks; cannot be created by mixing (red, blue, yellow).  
- **Secondary colors:** Mixes of two primaries (green, orange, purple).  
- **Tertiary colors:** Primary + neighboring secondary (yellow-orange, blue-green, red-purple).  

Tertiary colors give more nuance and flexibility in dashboard palettes.

---

## Color Harmony Schemes for Dashboards

Understanding color relationships helps you create **balanced, readable** dashboards.

### Monochromatic Scheme

![Monochromiatic scheme](../../img/tableau/w4_monochromic_scheme.png)

- Variations of a **single hue** (tints, shades, tones).  
- Very cohesive, calm, and professional.  
- Ideal for **minimalist dashboards** and background colors.

### Analogous Scheme

![Analogous scheme](../../img/tableau/w4_analogous_scheme.png)

- Uses colors **next to each other** on the wheel.  
- Creates smooth, natural transitions.  
- Works well for gradients or multi-series charts with subtle differences.

### Complementary Scheme

![Complementary scheme](../../img/tableau/w4_complementary_scheme.png)

- Colors **opposite** each other on the wheel.  
- High contrast and strong visual energy.  
- Great for **highlighting key metrics** or “good vs bad” signals.

### Compound Scheme

![Compound scheme](../../img/tableau/w4_compound_scheme.png)

- Mix of **two or more non-adjacent** colors.  
- Often forms a rectangle or square on the color wheel.  
- Balances variety and harmony.

### Tetradic Scheme

![Tetradic scheme](../../img/tableau/w4_tetradic_scheme.png)

- Uses **four colors** evenly spaced on the wheel.  
- Very vibrant and expressive.  
- Should be used carefully to avoid visual overload.

---

### Additional Useful Schemes

#### Split-Complementary Scheme

- One base color + the two neighbors of its complement.  
- Keeps high contrast but is less aggressive than a pure complementary scheme.  

#### Neutral Scheme

- Focuses on **grays, whites, blacks, and muted tones**.  
- Perfect for analytic dashboards where **data, not color**, is the hero.

#### Warm vs Cool Palettes

- **Warm colors** (red, orange, yellow) → energy, urgency, attention.  
- **Cool colors** (blue, green, purple) → calm, trust, stability.  

Use warm colors to highlight, cool colors as the baseline.

## Design Principles for Color in Dashboards

Effective dashboards combine **color harmony, functionality, readability, consistency, and accessibility**.

### Color Harmony

Choose colors that **work well together** and reflect the brand or context.  
Limit the number of hues; vary intensity instead.

### Functionality

Color should:

- Guide attention  
- Signal status (e.g., red vs green)  
- Help group related elements  

Every color should have a **clear role**.

### Readability

Use color to support comprehension, not to decorate.

Semantic example:

- **Green** → growth, success, “good”  
- **Red** → decline, risk, “bad”

### Simplicity Through Consistency

- Reuse the **same colors** for the same concepts across dashboards.  
- Too many colors reduce clarity and create cognitive overload.

### Accessibility

Design for users with **color vision deficiencies**:

- Do not rely on color alone to encode information.  
- Ensure strong contrast between foreground and background.  
- Test palettes with tools like [Coblis](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/).

## UX Principles for Dashboard Design

This section summarizes **7 key UX principles** for effective dashboards.

### 1. User-Centricity

Design for **specific users and use cases**, not for “everyone”.

Ask:

- Who is my audience? (role, data literacy, time)  
- What decisions will they make with this dashboard?  
- Do they need a quick overview, detailed analysis, or both?

Analysts may want detail and complexity; executives prefer clarity and summaries.

---

### 2. Usefulness

A dashboard is only valuable if it **supports real decisions or tasks**.

Ask:

- Is this dashboard truly needed?  
- Does it replace or improve existing workflows (Excel decks, manual reports)?  
- Which questions does it answer?

Avoid “dashboard for the sake of dashboard”.

---

### 3. Credibility

Users must **trust** your dashboard.

- Validate data sources.  
- Show time stamps or update frequency.  
- Avoid misleading charts and titles.

Use zero baselines on bar charts  
Label key values directly  
Avoid showing only cumulative numbers when rates matter

![Credibility Example](../../img/tableau/w4_credibility.png)

---

### 4. Consistency

Consistency makes dashboards **predictable and intuitive**.

Types:

- **Visual:** Same colors, fonts, line styles.  
- **Functional:** Interactions (clicks, hovers) behave similarly.  
- **Naming:** Metrics and categories are named consistently.  
- **Contextual:** Align with brand guidelines.

![Consistency Example](../../img/tableau/w4_consistency.png)

---

### 5. Clarity

**Less is more.**

Use Tufte’s data-ink ratio:

- Remove decorative elements and clutter.  
- Keep text short and direct.  
- Emphasize the most important metrics first.

![Clarity Example](../../img/tableau/w4_clarity.png)

---

### 6. Hierarchy

Visual hierarchy guides the eye through the dashboard.

Use:

- Position (top-left is most prominent)  
- Size (big = important)  
- Contrast (bold vs subtle)  
- Grouping (containers, white space)

**Squint test:** If you squint and still see the main message, your hierarchy works.

---

### 7. Accessibility

Make dashboards usable for **everyone**:

- Use clear fonts (10–12 pt+).  
- Keep layouts simple.  
- Don’t rely solely on tooltips or hover for important info.  
- Test contrast and color palettes.

## Dashboard Layout Best Practices

### Using Layout Containers in Tableau

Containers help you **organize and align** content.

Types:

- **Horizontal containers** – arrange elements side by side.  
- **Vertical containers** – stack elements top to bottom.

---

### 1. Adding a Layout Container

- Drag a **Vertical Container** from the *Dashboard* pane onto the canvas.  
- You may hold **Shift** to make it floating and position it manually.  
- Use a light background color to see boundaries while designing.

---

### 2. Container Structure

- **Single-level** containers hold several elements directly.  
- **Nested** containers allow complex layouts (e.g., two charts on the left, one tall chart on the right).

---

### 3. Adding Elements

- Start with **Blank** objects to design the grid.  
- Then drag worksheets, text, and images into those positions.

---

### 4. Orientation

- Dropping items on the **left/right** edge → horizontal arrangement.  
- Dropping items on the **top/bottom** edge → vertical arrangement.

---

### 5. Fitting Visualizations

- Use **Fit Entire View** to ensure charts adapt to container size.  
- Use **Fixed Width/Height** for consistent sizing.  
- Distribute content evenly when you want equal column/row sizes.

| ![Fit entire view](../../img/tableau/w4_entire_view.png) | ![Fixed width](../../img/tableau/w4_fixed_width) | ![Distribute content](../../img/tableau/w4_distribute_content.png) |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Fit Entire View | Fixed Width/Height | Distribute Content |

---

### 6. Padding

- **Inner padding:** space between the container edge and content (breathing room).  
- **Outer padding:** space between the container and other objects (spacing and hierarchy).

---

### 7. Scaling Options

- **Fixed size:** same size everywhere (best for presentations).  
- **Range:** flexible within min–max bounds (for laptops/desktops).  
- **Automatic:** fills available space (great for responsive dashboards, but test carefully).

---

### 8. Scrollable Dashboards

Scrollable dashboards are especially helpful for **multifunctional** or **analytic** views with many sections.

To create:

1. Use a **fixed height** smaller than the content height (e.g., dashboard 900px tall, content 1600px).  
2. Place content inside a **vertical container** — Tableau will add a vertical scroll bar.  
3. Keep key KPIs near the top; use section titles as anchors.  
4. Avoid multiple nested scroll areas.

---

## Types of Dashboards

Following *Stephen Few*, we classify dashboards by **function**:

- **Operational**  
- **Tactical**  
- **Analytical**  
- **Strategic**  
- **Multifunctional / Self-Service**

Each serves a different decision-making level.

---

### 1. Operational Dashboards

> **Question:** “What is happening right now?”

- **Purpose:** Monitor day-to-day operations and detect issues as they occur.  
- **Audience:** Frontline staff, operations teams, call center supervisors.  
- **Example:** Telecom operations dashboard with uptime, call drop rate, open tickets.

Common visuals:

- KPI cards with thresholds  
- Gauges / bullet charts  
- Real-time tables and alerts  

![Operational Dashboard](../../img/tableau/w4_operational_dashboards.png)

---

### 2. Tactical Dashboards

> **Question:** “How are we performing against our goals?”

- **Purpose:** Track short- and mid-term performance vs targets.  
- **Audience:** Team leads, department heads, project managers.  
- **Example:** Sales dashboard tracking regional results vs monthly targets.

Common visuals:

- Variance-to-target bars  
- Trend lines by month/quarter  
- Progress bars by region/team  

![Tactical Dashboard](../../img/tableau/w4_tactical_dashboards.png)

---

### 3. Analytical Dashboards

> **Question:** “Why is this happening?”

- **Purpose:** Explore data deeply, detect patterns, and understand root causes.  
- **Audience:** Data analysts, BI teams, advanced users.  
- **Example:** Churn dashboard showing which segments are at higher risk and why.

Common visuals:

- Heatmaps  
- Scatter plots  
- Cohort charts  
- Drillable tables  

![Analytical Dashboard](../../img/tableau/w4_analytical_dashboards.png)

---

### 4. Strategic Dashboards

> **Question:** “Where are we heading?”

- **Purpose:** Provide a high-level view of organizational performance and strategy.  
- **Audience:** Executives, directors, board members.  
- **Example:** Executive dashboard with revenue, profitability, market share, and satisfaction over time.

Common visuals:

- KPI scorecards  
- Trend lines & forecasts  
- High-level maps and summaries  

![Strategic Dashboard](../../img/tableau/w4_strategic_dashboards.png)

---

### 5. Multifunctional Dashboards

Some dashboards combine elements from several types.

**Purpose:** Allow users to access multiple levels of insight in one place.

Example:

- Top section → **Overview** (strategic KPIs + operational health).  
- Lower sections → **Detailed analysis** (trends, breakdowns, drill-downs).

💡 Best practice: design these as **scrollable dashboards** with clear sections.

![Multifunctional Dashboard](../../img/tableau/w4_multifunctional_dashboards.png)

---

### Dashboard Type Summary

| Type | Question | Audience | Update Frequency | Focus | Example KPI |
|------|----------|----------|------------------|-------|-------------|
| **Operational** | What’s happening now? | Frontline teams | Real-time | Efficiency | Average handling time |
| **Tactical** | Are we meeting our goals? | Managers | Weekly / Monthly | Performance | Sales vs target |
| **Analytical** | Why is this happening? | Analysts | On-demand | Insight & causes | Churn drivers |
| **Strategic** | Where are we heading? | Executives | Monthly / Quarterly | Outcomes | Revenue growth |

---

## Reflection and Discussion

1. Which dashboard type do you use most often in your current work or study?  
2. Where do you see **chartjunk** or poor color use in real dashboards around you?  
3. How could you redesign one of your own dashboards using Tufte’s principles and color harmony?

Take notes or share examples in class.
