## Introduction


**Tableau** enables analysts to explore data visually, identify patterns, and communicate insights clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences. Instead of writing queries, you interact with data through fields, shelves, and visual encodings.


**Because the best way to learn Tableau is by building,** each concept introduced in this chapter is reinforced through hands-on practice.

---

## What Is Tableau?

**Tableau** is a data visualization and analytics platform designed to help people see and understand their data.  
It transforms raw datasets into meaningful visual stories that support data-driven decision-making.

Tableau connects easily to spreadsheets, databases, and cloud data sources, enabling analysts to explore data visually without writing complex code.

## Core Tableau Concepts

### Dimensions vs. Measures

- **Dimensions** represent qualitative fields used to categorize data  
- **Measures** represent quantitative fields that can be aggregated  

| Example | Type |
|----------|------|
| `Property Type` | Dimension |
| `Room Type` | Dimension |
| `COUNT(Number of Records)` | Measure |
| `COUNT(Number of Reviews)` | Measure |


## How to Recognize a Measure in Tableau

In Tableau, a **measure** is typically a numeric field that is **aggregated** in a visualization.

### Primary Visual Cue

The most common way to recognize a measure is by looking at how the field appears in the view:

- Measures usually appear with an **aggregation function** applied  
- The aggregation is shown before the field name

**Example:**
- `AVG(Review Scores Rating)`
- `COUNT(Number of Reviews)`

If you see an aggregation (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.), the field is behaving as a **measure**.

---

::: {.callout-important}

While aggregation is the strongest indicator, there are several important exceptions to understand.

:::


### 1. Date Fields

Date fields are often **dimensions**, even though they appear with a function applied.

**Example:**
- `YEAR(Host Since)`
- `MONTH(Host Since)`

In these cases, the function represents **date granularity**, not aggregation.  
The field is still acting as a **dimension**.

---

### 2. Aggregated Dimensions

Some **dimensions** can appear aggregated when used with specific functions, such as:

- `COUNT(Customer ID)`
- `ATTR(Region)`

Although these fields look like measures in the view, they originate as **dimensions** in the data model.

This behavior is common when:
- Counting unique values  `COUNTD()`
- Displaying a single value per partition `ATTR()` 

---

### 3. Table Calculations

All **table calculations** are treated as measures in Tableau.

Characteristics of table calculations:
- Display a **delta (∆) icon** in the Data Pane  
- May or may not show an explicit aggregation  
- Are computed *after* the data is aggregated in the view  

Examples include:
- Percent difference  
- Running totals  
- Rank  

---

### 4. Disaggregated Views

If **Disaggregate Measures** is enabled:

- All fields in the view behave as **dimensions**
- No aggregation functions are applied
- Each row of the underlying data is shown individually

This mode is useful for record-level inspection but uncommon for final dashboards.

| ![Disaggregated measures](../../img/tableau/w1_disaggregated_measures.png) | 

---

::: {.callout-tip}


When identifying a measure, ask:

- Is the field numeric?
- Is it aggregated (SUM, AVG, COUNT)?
- Does it represent a quantity to analyze rather than a category?

If the answer is yes, the field is behaving as a **measure**.

:::

---

### Discrete vs. Continuous Fields

In Tableau, fields can behave as **discrete** or **continuous**, which determines **how values are displayed** in a visualization and **how users interpret patterns**.

- **Discrete fields** create **separate categories or headers** (shown as **blue pills**)  
- **Continuous fields** create **numeric or time-based scales** (shown as **green pills**)

---

| Type | Example | Effect |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Discrete** | `Beds` | Creates labels or categories |
| **Continuous** | `Number of Records` | Creates an axis with a scale |

---

| ![Continuous](../../img/tableau/w1_continuous.png) | ![Discrete](../../img/tableau/w1_descrete.png) |
|:--:|:--:|
| **Continuous** | **Discrete** |

---

::: {.callout-note}

The absence of an aggregation function in the `Beds` field name indicates that it is a **dimension**, and therefore appears as a **discrete field** by default.

:::


### How Discrete Fields Behave

Discrete fields:

- Break data into **distinct groups**
- Display values as **headers** rather than on an axis
- Are commonly used for:
  - Categories (Region, Property Type)
  - Date parts (YEAR, MONTH, WEEK)
  - Bins and groups


---

### How Continuous Fields Behave

Continuous fields:

- Represent values along a **range**
- Create an **axis** that allows comparison 
- Are commonly used for:
  - Measures (Sales, Profit, Counts)
  - Continuous dates (timeline analysis)


---


### Dates: A Special Case

Date fields can behave as **either discrete or continuous**, depending on how they are used.

- **Discrete date** → creates date categories (e.g., `Month(Host Since)`)
- **Continuous date** → creates a time axis (e.g., `Host Since`)

This choice significantly affects how trends and patterns are perceived.

---

::: {.callout-tip}

You can convert a field between **discrete (blue)** and **continuous (green)** by:
1. Right-clicking the field (pill or Data Pane)
2. Selecting **Convert to Discrete** or **Convert to Continuous**

Choose discrete when you want **categories**  
Choose continuous when you want to analyze **values across a scale****

:::


## Creating Your First Visualization

### Step 1: Connect to Data

- Go to **Data → Connect to Data**
- Select **Excel** or **Text File**
- Choose `airbnb.xlsx` and drag the sheet into the workspace

---

### Step 2: Explore Data Types

Identify fields in the Data Pane:
- Numeric (decimal / whole)
- Date or Date & Time
- String (text)
- Geographic roles

---

### Step 3: Build Basic Charts

| Chart | Purpose | Example |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Bar Chart | Compare categories | `Name` vs `SUM(Number of Records)` |
| Line Chart | Show trends | `Month(Host Since)` vs `SUM(Number of Records)` |
| Pie Chart | Show proportions | `Property Type` vs `SUM(Number of Records)` |
| Scatter Plot | Show relationships | `SUM(Price)` vs `SUM(Beds)` |

| ![Bar Chart](../../img/tableau/w1_bar_chart.png) | ![Line Chart](../../img/tableau/w1_line_chart.png) | ![Pie Chart](../../img/tableau/w1_pie_chart.png) | ![Scatter Plot](../../img/tableau/w1_scatter_plot.png) |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Bar | Line | Pie | Scatter |

### Bar Charts

Bar charts are best used to:
- Compare **individual categories**
- Rank values from highest to lowest
- Highlight differences between groups

Typical use cases:
- Sales by region
- Number of listings by property type
- Average price by neighborhood

---

### Line Charts

Line charts are ideal for:
- Visualizing **change over time**
- Identifying trends, seasonality, or patterns
- Comparing multiple time series

Typical use cases:
- Monthly revenue trends
- Daily bookings over time
- Profit trends by category

---

### Pie Charts

Pie charts show:
- **Relative contribution** of categories to a total
- Proportional relationships within a whole

Typical use cases:
- Revenue share by category
- Distribution of listings by room type

---

### Scatter Plots

Scatter plots are used to:
- Explore **relationships between two quantitative variables**
- Identify correlations, clusters, and outliers

Typical use cases:
- Price vs number of reviews
- Sales vs profit
- Size vs occupancy rate

---

### Step 4: Apply Filters, Groups, and Sets

Filters, groups, and sets allow you to **control what data is shown**, **how categories are combined**, and **which records are emphasized** in a visualization.  
They are essential for focusing analysis and adding interactivity to dashboards.

---

| Function | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Filters** | Limit the data shown in the view | `[Region] = "East"` |
| **Groups** | Combine multiple categories into one | Small cities → `Other` |
| **Sets** | Define dynamic or conditional subsets | Sales > 5000 |
| **Sorting** | Control the order of values | Profit descending |

---

| ![Filters](../../img/tableau/w1_filter.png) | ![Groups](../../img/tableau/w1_group.png) | ![Sets](../../img/tableau/w1_set.png) | ![Sorting](../../img/tableau/w1_sort.png) |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| **Filters** | **Groups** | **Sets** | **Sorting** |

---

### Filters

Filters are used to **restrict the data** displayed in a worksheet or dashboard.

Common filter types:
- **Dimension filters** (e.g., Region, Category)
- **Measure filters** (e.g., Sales > 1000)
- **Date filters** (relative dates, ranges)
- **Context filters** (define a primary filtering scope)

Typical use cases:
- Focus on a specific region or time period
- Reduce clutter by removing irrelevant categories
- Enable user-driven exploration through dashboard controls

---

### Groups

Groups allow you to **manually combine categories** into higher-level buckets.

Key characteristics:
- Static and manually defined
- Useful for simplifying long categorical lists
- Do not change automatically with data updates

---

### Sets

Sets define a **subset of data** based on conditions or selections.

Key characteristics:
- Can be **dynamic** (based on rules)
- Can be **interactive** (user selection)
- Can be used in calculations and comparisons

---

### Sorting

Sorting controls the **order in which categories appear** in a view.

Sorting options include:
- Ascending or descending
- Sort by field value or by another measure
- Manual sorting
