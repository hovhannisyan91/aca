# Tableau Tutorial

## Introduction to Tableau

- **Week 1: Intro**
  - Connect to basic data sources (Excel, CSV)
  - Workbooks  
  - Data types  
  - Dimensions vs. Measures  
  - Discrete vs. Continuous fields  
  - Tableau interface (shelves, marks, filters, dashboards, buttons)  
  - Create basic charts: bar, line, pie, scatter  
  - Use filters, groups, sets, and sorting  
  - **Task:** Publish your first simple dashboard

#### Connect to basic data sources (Excel, CSV)



**Tableau Products**
- Tableau Server: On-premise platform that enables organizations to share dashboards privately
- Tableau Cloud: Cloud-based platform for sharing and managing dashboards without needing any server infrastructure
- Tableau Public: Free, cloud-based platform that enables Tableau enthusiasts to publish their dashboards
- Tableau Next: Automated insight generation and trend detection
- Tableau Desktop: Tool for creating visualizations and publishing them on Tableau Cloud, Tableau Server or Tableau Public
- Tableau Prep: Data preparation tool

**Tableau File Types**
- Workbooks (.twb)
- Bookmarks (.tbm)
- Packaged Workbooks (.twbx)
- Extract (.hyper)
- Data Source (.tds)
- Packaged Data Source (.tdsx)

**Tableau Desktop Public Edition** enables making visualizations and managing dashboards
- **Online**
- **Offline**

#### Data Types

- Number (Decimal)
- Number (Whole): [Host ID]
- Date: [Host Since]
- Date & Time
- String: [Property Type]
- Geographic Role: [Zip Code]
- Boolean values

#### Dimensions vs Measures

- Dimensions typically contain qualitative values (such as names, dates, or geographical data) and are used to categorize the data.
- Measures are aggregated. Measures typically contain numeric, quantitative values that you can measure. 

#### Discrete vs Continuous

- **Discrete:** individually separate and distinct — `Name`
- **Continuous:** forming an unbroken whole, without interruption — `SUM(Number of Reviews)`

#### Field Types
1. Discrete Dimension: A discrete dimension breaks data into distinct categories. 
2. Discrete Measure: A numerical measure that treated as a set of distinct values.
3. Continuous Dimension: A numeric or date dimension displayed across a continuous axis. 
4. Continuous Measure: The most common type — numeric values shown across a continuous axis.

*Note: Dimensions with a data type of String or Boolean can’t be continuous. Dates are the most common continuous dimension.*

You can convert measures from discrete to continuous or from continuous to discrete. Click the field and choose Discrete or Continuous.

#### Tableau Interface (shelves, marks, filters, dashboards, buttons)
Main sections:
- **A:** Data Pane – contains all fields (dimensions, measures, parameters)
- **B:** Shelves – control how fields appear in your view
- **C:** Marks Card – controls visual elements (color, size, shape, label)
- **D:** Filters Shelf – limits data shown in the view
- **E:** Dashboard Pane – combines multiple sheets into one display
- **F:** Toolbar & Buttons – quick access to tools (undo, redo, sort, etc.)

#### Create Basic Charts

|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Bar Chart | Line Chart | Pie Chart | Scatter Plot |

#### Use Filters, Groups, Sets, and Sorting
| ![Filters](../../img/tableau/w1_filter.png) | ![Groups](../../img/tableau/w1_group.png) | ![Sets](../../img/tableau/w1_set.png) | ![Sorting](../../img/tableau/w1_sort.png) |
