# Introduction to Tableau

This chapter sets the foundation for working with **Tableau** — from connecting to data, through building your first visuals, to publishing a simple dashboard.  
You’ll learn core concepts (dimensions, measures, discrete/continuous), get oriented in the interface, and apply best practices while creating your first views.

> By the end of the class, you should be able to connect to common data sources, explain Tableau’s core data concepts, and publish a simple, well-structured dashboard with basic interactivity.

## What Is Tableau?

**Tableau** is a visual analytics platform that turns data into insight through interactive charts and dashboards.  
In practice, Tableau bridges **raw tables** and **business understanding**, enabling you to explore, explain, and share findings quickly.

The typical Tableau workflow follows five stages:

1. **Connect** – link to files (Excel/CSV), databases, or cloud sources.  
2. **Prepare** – profile fields, set data types, create relationships/joins, and fix quality issues.  
3. **Visualize** – build views on shelves with Marks (color/size/label/shape).  
4. **Compose** – assemble sheets in dashboards; add filters, actions, and layout.  
5. **Publish & Share** – deliver to Tableau Public, Cloud, or Server for feedback and decision-making.

> This flow is iterative: each visualization raises new questions — adjust, test, and refine.

## Business Applications of Tableau

Tableau supports decision-making across multiple industries:

- **Telecommunications:** network KPIs, churn monitoring, device mix, and customer segmentation.  
- **Retail & E-commerce:** category performance, retention cohorts, and funnel analysis.  
- **Finance:** credit risk dashboards, revenue tracking, portfolio monitoring.  
- **Marketing:** campaign attribution, A/B test results, and media mix performance.  
- **Healthcare & Public Sector:** patient outcomes, resource management, and geographic analytics.

**Unifying theme:** Tableau accelerates how analysts move from **questions → visuals → decisions**.

## Dimensions vs. Measures

- **Dimensions** contain qualitative fields (categories such as names, dates, or geographic data).  
  → Used to *group*, *filter*, and *categorize* data.  
- **Measures** contain quantitative, numeric fields.  
  → Used to *aggregate* and *analyze* data (SUM, AVG, COUNT).

---

## Discrete vs. Continuous Fields

| Concept | Description | Example |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Discrete** | Distinct categories, shown as separate labels or headers. | `Customer Name`, `Region` |
| **Continuous** | Numeric or time fields forming an unbroken scale. | `SUM(Sales)`, `Order Date` |

**Tip:** You can convert measures or dimensions between discrete and continuous using the field dropdown.
