## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to:

* Install and configure a Python development environment using Miniconda
* Create and manage isolated Python environments
* Install common data analysis libraries
* Run Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks
* Understand Python fundamentals (syntax, data types, loops, functions)
* Connect Python to a PostgreSQL database

## 1. Installing Miniconda

Miniconda is a minimal installer for Conda that allows us to manage Python versions and packages efficiently.

1. Go to: [https://www.anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
2. Scroll to **Miniconda Installers → macOS**
3. Download **macOS (Apple Silicon arm64)** (`.pkg` file)
4. Double-click the downloaded file and follow the installer steps

### macOS Installation (Intel – rare in 2026)

Intel Macs are no longer actively supported (last packages ~mid-2025).  
If you have an older Intel Mac:

* Use archived installer: [https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/)  
  → look for `Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg`
* Or consider Miniforge (conda-forge default): [https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)

Install the same way as shown above.
---

## Why Use Isolated Environments?

Python environments allow you to separate projects and avoid conflicts.

They help you:

Avoid version conflicts between libraries
Keep your base environment clean
Reproduce analyses on other machines
Safely test new libraries or versions
Share identical setups with teammates

Think of environments as “self-contained toolboxes” for each project.

---

## Creating a New Environment

Open **Anaconda Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (macOS/Linux)

```bash
# Basic syntax
conda create --name my-env python=3.11

---

## Activating the Environment

```bash
# Basic syntax
conda activate my-env

Your terminal prompt should change to show the environment name.

```(base) user@machine ~ % conda activate data-analysis
(data-analysis) user@machine ~ %
```
**Important rule**
Always activate the correct environment before installing packages or running code.

---

## Installing packages

```
# Preferred: use conda for scientific packages (better dependency handling)
conda install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

# Or install JupyterLab + extras
conda install jupyterlab plotly sqlalchemy psycopg2

# Use pip when a package is missing from conda channels
pip install pandas-profiling great-tables
```
---

## Essential Management Commands

```
# List all environments
conda env list

# See current environment packages
conda list

# Deactivate (go back to base)
conda deactivate

# Delete an environment (careful!)
conda env remove --name data-analysis

# Update all packages in current env
conda update --all

# Clean up unused packages & cache (frees disk space)
conda clean --all
```
---

## Installing libraries

| Library    | Purpose                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| pandas     | Data manipulation & analysis   |
| numpy      | Numerical computing            |
| matplotlib | Low-level plotting             |
| seaborn    | Statistical data visualization |
| psycopg2   | PostgreSQL database adapter    |

---

### How to install core libraries

Using `conda`

```
conda install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn psycopg2
```
---
### Installing and launching Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebooks allow you to mix

* Code
* Text explanations
* Visualizations
* Results

They are widely used in data analytics for exploration and teaching.

Why Jupyter?

* Immediate feedback
* Step-by-step execution
* Inline plots and tables
* Great for experimentation and learning

---

Using `conda`

```
conda install notebook

jupyter notebook
```
---
### Verifying installation

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import psycopg2
```

If no errors appear, your setup is correct.
### pandas

- DataFrame and Series data structures
- Handles tabular, time-series, and relational data
- SQL-like operations (join, groupby, filter)

---

### numpy

- N-dimensional arrays (ndarray)
- Vectorized operations
- Fast numerical computation

---

### Visualisation libraries

**matplotlib**

- Low-level plotting library
- Full control over figures, axes, styles
- Base library for seaborn

---

**seaborn**

- High-level interface for statistical graphics
- Built on top of matplotlib
- Works directly with pandas DataFrames

---

## Python Fundamentals (Overview)

Python is a general-purpose language with a strong focus on readability.

### Examples of common data types

Python variables can store different kinds of values — and each kind of value has a type that determines what you can do with it.

--- 

[Text Type: `str` (Strings)]{.mark}

```python
name = "Alice"
greeting = 'Hello everyone!'
```

Strings are sequences of characters, and you can:
* Join them
* Slice them
* Format them into output

---
#### Numeric Types

Integers (int)

Whole numbers, no decimal point:

```python
age = 30
year = 2026
```

Floating-Point (float)

Numbers with decimal points:

```python
pi = 3.14159
temperature = -5.2
```

Complex Numbers (complex)

Used for advanced math:

```python
z = 2 + 3j
```

Numeric types can be added, multiplied, compared, and used in math expressions.

---
#### Sequence Types

List — `list`

Lists store multiple values:
```python
fruits = ["apple", 3.14, True]
```

Lists are:
* Ordered
* Mutable (you can change them)
* Indexable with [0], [1], etc.

---
Tuple — `tuple`

Tuples look like lists but cannot be changed after creation:

```python
coords = (10, 20)
```
---
Range — `range`

Often used in loops:

```python
nums = range(5)   # produces 0,1,2,3,4
```
Great for iterating a fixed number of times.
---

Mapping Type — `dict` (Dictionaries)

Associates keys with values:

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
```
Dictionaries are:
* Unordered (in older Python versions)
* Fast for lookup by key
* Very common in data work (JSON-like)

---

Set Types — `set` and `frozenset`

Set Types — `set`: stores unique values

```python
colors = {"red", "green", "blue"}
```
If you add `"red"` again, it won’t duplicate.

Frozen Set `frozenset`

Like a set, but immutable — once created it can’t change.
---

Boolean Type — `bool` 

There are only two possible values:

```python
True
False
```
Booleans are essential for:
* Filtering data
* Writing conditions
* Validating assumptions in analysis
---
Bonus: Comparison Operators (Return Booleans)

These operators always return `True` or `False`:
```python
x == y   # equal
x != y   # not equal
x > y    # greater than
x < y    # less than
x >= y   # greater or equal
x <= y   # less or equal
```
---
Boolean Logic Operators

Combine multiple conditions using:
```python
and   # both conditions must be True
or    # at least one condition must be True
not   # reverses the value
```
Example:
```python
age = 22
has_ticket = True

can_enter = age >= 18 and has_ticket

```
---

## Connecting PostreSQL to Python

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it. (You already know how to do this!)
2. Install the psyopg2 package. (you also know how to do this!) Create the requirements.txt file.

```
conda install -c conda-forge psycopg2
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
---
### 3. Creating a new database

Connect to PostgreSQL servier using psql tool and create a new database called suppliers.

```
psql -U postgres

CREATE DATABASE suppliers;
```
Now exit the psql.
```
exit
```
