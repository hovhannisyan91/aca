    "text": "What Is Data Analytics?\nData analytics is the practice of examining data systematically to discover useful information, reach conclusions, and support decision-making.\nIn practice, it bridges raw data and business strategy. The process typically follows five stages:\n\nData Generation – transactions, sensors, user interactions, or surveys produce raw data.\n\nCollection and Storage – data is gathered and kept in databases, data warehouses, or cloud systems.\n\nProcessing and Integration – data is cleaned, formatted, and connected across sources.\n\nAnalysis and Modeling – statistical or machine-learning methods reveal patterns and predict outcomes.\n\nCommunication and Action – visualizations, dashboards, and reports communicate insights for business decisions.\n\nThis “data-to-insight” flow is iterative; every analysis generates new questions that feed the next cycle."

    "text": "What Is Data Analytics?\nData analytics is the practice of examining data systematically to discover useful information, reach conclusions, and support decision-making.\nIn practice, it bridges raw data and business strategy. The process typically follows five stages:\n\nData Generation – transactions, sensors, user interactions, or surveys produce raw data.\n\nCollection and Storage – data is gathered and kept in databases, data warehouses, or cloud systems.\n\nProcessing and Integration – data is cleaned, formatted, and connected across sources.\n\nAnalysis and Modeling – statistical or machine-learning methods reveal patterns and predict outcomes.\n\nCommunication and Action – visualizations, dashboards, and reports communicate insights for business decisions.\n\nThis “data-to-insight” flow is iterative; every analysis generates new questions that feed the next cycle."

Measures typically contain numeric, quantitative values that you can measure.\n\n\n\nDiscrete vs Continuous\n\nDiscrete: individually separate and distinct — Name\nContinuous: forming an unbroken whole, without interruption — SUM(Number of Reviews)\n\n\n\nField Types\n\nDiscrete Dimension: A discrete dimension breaks data into distinct categories.\nDiscrete Measure: A numerical measure that treated as a set of distinct values.\nContinuous Dimension: A numeric or date dimension displayed across a continuous axis.\nContinuous Measure: The most common type — numeric values shown across a continuous axis.\n\nNote: Dimensions with a data type of String or Boolean can’t be continuous. Dates are the most common continuous dimension.\nYou can convert measures from discrete to continuous or from continuous to discrete. Click the field and choose Discrete or Continuous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous\nDiscrete\n\n\n\n\n\nTableau Interface (shelves, marks, filters, dashboards, buttons)\nMain sections: - A: Data Pane – contains all fields (dimensions, measures, parameters) - B: Shelves – control how fields appear in your view - C: Marks Card – controls visual elements (color, size, shape, label) - D: Filters Shelf – limits data shown in the view - E: Dashboard Pane – combines multiple sheets into one display - F: Toolbar & Buttons – quick access to tools (undo, redo, sort, etc.)\n\n\n\nConnect to xlsx\n\n\n\n\nCreate Basic Charts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBar Chart\nLine Chart\nPie Chart\nScatter Plot\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Filters, Groups, Sets, and Sorting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilters\nGroups\nSets\nSorting\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 2: Intermediate Visual Analytics\n\nConnect to databases (PostgreSQL)\nWork with data joins, blends, unions, and relationships\nGet CSV from SQL Stored Procedure using Python\nDual-axis charts, histograms, boxplots, heatmaps\nCalculated fields (row-level vs aggregate)\n\nParameters (interactive filtering)\nTypes of filters (including dashboard actions)\nTask: Build dashboards with interactivity (actions, filters, tooltips)\n\n\n\n\nWork with Data Joins, Blends, Unions, and Relationships",

Tufte is an American statistician, artist, and Yale professor, often referred to as the father of data visualization.\nHe teaches that visual storytelling should combine truth, clarity, and design integrity — allowing the story within data to emerge naturally.\n\n“Above all else, show the data.”\n\n\nHis most influential books\n\nThe Visual Display of Quantitative Information\n\nEnvisioning Information\n\nBeautiful Evidence\n\nTufte’s principles are not about decoration but purposeful simplicity — every mark, color, or shape should tell part of the story.",
