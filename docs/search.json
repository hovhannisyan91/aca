    "text": "What Is Data Analytics?\nData analytics is the practice of examining data systematically to discover useful information, reach conclusions, and support decision-making.\nIn practice, it bridges raw data and business strategy. The process typically follows five stages:\n\nData Generation – transactions, sensors, user interactions, or surveys produce raw data.\n\nCollection and Storage – data is gathered and kept in databases, data warehouses, or cloud systems.\n\nProcessing and Integration – data is cleaned, formatted, and connected across sources.\n\nAnalysis and Modeling – statistical or machine-learning methods reveal patterns and predict outcomes.\n\nCommunication and Action – visualizations, dashboards, and reports communicate insights for business decisions.\n\nThis “data-to-insight” flow is iterative; every analysis generates new questions that feed the next cycle."

    "text": "What Is Data Analytics?\nData analytics is the practice of examining data systematically to discover useful information, reach conclusions, and support decision-making.\nIn practice, it bridges raw data and business strategy. The process typically follows five stages:\n\nData Generation – transactions, sensors, user interactions, or surveys produce raw data.\n\nCollection and Storage – data is gathered and kept in databases, data warehouses, or cloud systems.\n\nProcessing and Integration – data is cleaned, formatted, and connected across sources.\n\nAnalysis and Modeling – statistical or machine-learning methods reveal patterns and predict outcomes.\n\nCommunication and Action – visualizations, dashboards, and reports communicate insights for business decisions.\n\nThis “data-to-insight” flow is iterative; every analysis generates new questions that feed the next cycle."
