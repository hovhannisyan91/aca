    "text": "Visual Storytelling Principles\n\nThe Role of Edward Tufte in Visual Storytelling\nIn the field of visual storytelling, Edward R. Tufte plays a foundational role.\nHis work connects data, design, and narrative, showing how information can be communicated not only clearly but also elegantly.\nTufte’s philosophy encourages designers and analysts to transform raw data into visual stories that inform and move audiences.\n\n“Above all else, show the data.”\n\n\n\nWho is Edward Tufte?\nEdward R. Tufte is an American statistician, artist, and former Yale professor, often called the father of data visualization.\nHe argues that visual storytelling should combine:\n\nTruth – no distortion of data\n\nClarity – no unnecessary complexity\n\nDesign integrity – every element has a purpose\n\nHis most influential books include:\n\nThe Visual Display of Quantitative Information\n\nEnvisioning Information\n\nBeautiful Evidence\n\nTufte’s principles are not about decoration but purposeful simplicity — every mark, color, or shape should tell part of the story.\n\n\n\nStorytelling with Data: Minard’s Map of the 1812 Russian Campaign\n\n\n\nMinard’s Map\n\n\nCharles Joseph Minard’s famous visualization tells the tragic story of Napoleon’s march to Moscow:\n\nThe width of the band represents the army size at each stage.\n\nThe path shows geographic direction.\n\nThe line below shows temperatures during the retreat.\n\nTogether, these layers merge six variables into one coherent narrative.\nWhy it matters:\n\nShows that data can convey emotion and consequence, not just numbers.\n\nEmbodies Tufte’s core message: “Above all else, show the data.”\n\nDemonstrates clarity, precision, and storytelling depth.\n\nStorytelling takeaway:\nA single visual can tell a complete story — if every element is meaningful.\n\n\n\nAvoid “Chartjunk” — Keep the Story Clear\n\n\n\nChartjunk Example\n\n\nChartjunk refers to unnecessary decorative elements (3D effects, clip art, heavy borders, textures) that do not add information.\nWhy it matters:\n\nVisual noise hides the message; simplicity reveals it.\n\nGuideline:\nEvery pixel, line, and color must serve the story, not style.\n\n\n\nMaximize the Data-Ink Ratio — Tell More with Less\n\n\n\nData-Ink Ratio Example\n\n\nThe data-ink ratio describes how much of the ink in a chart actually represents data (instead of decoration).\nStorytelling principle:\n\nWhen visuals are simplified, the message becomes more powerful.\n\nPractical rules:\n\nRemove redundant labels and borders.\n\nUse subtle gridlines or remove them if they don’t help.\n\nHighlight only what matters (e.g., key lines, outliers).\n\n\n\n\nSmall Multiples — Comparing Stories Side by Side\n\n\n\nSmall Multiples Example\n\n\nSmall multiples are sets of similar charts that share the same scale and layout.\nWhy they work:\n\nMake it easy to compare patterns across time, regions, or segments.\n\nEncourage exploration without overwhelming the viewer.\n\nStorytelling takeaway:\nUse repetition and consistent design to show change and contrast across multiple views.\n\n\n\nGraphical Integrity — Be Honest in Your Story\n\n\n\nLie Factor Example\n\n\nA visualization must not distort the data.\nKey practices:\n\nKeep proportions true to values (no misleading scaling).\n\nAvoid truncated axes that exaggerate small differences (especially on bar charts).\n\nRepresent differences accurately in height, length, and area.\n\nStorytelling takeaway:\nIntegrity builds credibility — the story must be as honest as the data.\n\n\n\nTufte’s Mindset in Dashboard Design\n\nFocus on the narrative: Highlight insights, not decoration.\n\nSimplify: Remove any element that doesn’t support the story.\n\nUse comparison wisely: Small multiples are powerful for showing change.\n\nBe truthful: Avoid distortion in axes, scales, and annotations.\n\nLayer context: Use time, geography, and value together when they clarify the story (like Minard’s map).",

    "text": "UX Principles for Dashboard Design\nThis section summarizes 7 key UX principles for effective dashboards.\n\n1. User-Centricity\nDesign for specific users and use cases, not for “everyone”.\nAsk:\n\nWho is my audience? (role, data literacy, time)\n\nWhat decisions will they make with this dashboard?\n\nDo they need a quick overview, detailed analysis, or both?\n\nAnalysts may want detail and complexity; executives prefer clarity and summaries.\n\n\n\n2. Usefulness\nA dashboard is only valuable if it supports real decisions or tasks.\nAsk:\n\nIs this dashboard truly needed?\n\nDoes it replace or improve existing workflows (Excel decks, manual reports)?\n\nWhich questions does it answer?\n\nAvoid “dashboard for the sake of dashboard”.\n\n\n\n3. Credibility\nUsers must trust your dashboard.\n\nValidate data sources.\n\nShow time stamps or update frequency.\n\nAvoid misleading charts and titles.\n\nUse zero baselines on bar charts\nLabel key values directly\nAvoid showing only cumulative numbers when rates matter\n\n\n\nCredibility Example\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Consistency\nConsistency makes dashboards predictable and intuitive.\nTypes:\n\nVisual: Same colors, fonts, line styles.\n\nFunctional: Interactions (clicks, hovers) behave similarly.\n\nNaming: Metrics and categories are named consistently.\n\nContextual: Align with brand guidelines.\n\n\n\n\nConsistency Example\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Clarity\nLess is more.\nUse Tufte’s data-ink ratio:\n\nRemove decorative elements and clutter.\n\nKeep text short and direct.\n\nEmphasize the most important metrics first.\n\n\n\n\nClarity Example\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Hierarchy\nVisual hierarchy guides the eye through the dashboard.\nUse:\n\nPosition (top-left is most prominent)\n\nSize (big = important)\n\nContrast (bold vs subtle)\n\nGrouping (containers, white space)\n\nSquint test: If you squint and still see the main message, your hierarchy works.\n\n\n\n7. Accessibility\nMake dashboards usable for everyone:\n\nUse clear fonts (10–12 pt+).\n\nKeep layouts simple.\n\nDon’t rely solely on tooltips or hover for important info.\n\nTest contrast and color palettes.\n\nResource: Dataviz Design Checklist",

    "section": "Dashboard Layout Best Practices",
    "text": "Dashboard Layout Best Practices\n\nUsing Layout Containers in Tableau\nContainers help you organize and align content.\nTypes:\n\nHorizontal containers – arrange elements side by side.\n\nVertical containers – stack elements top to bottom.\n\n\n\n\n1. Adding a Layout Container\n\nDrag a Vertical Container from the Dashboard pane onto the canvas.\n\nYou may hold Shift to make it floating and position it manually.\n\nUse a light background color to see boundaries while designing.\n\n\n\n\n2. Container Structure\n\nSingle-level containers hold several elements directly.\n\nNested containers allow complex layouts (e.g., two charts on the left, one tall chart on the right).\n\n\n\n\n3. Adding Elements\n\nStart with Blank objects to design the grid.\n\nThen drag worksheets, text, and images into those positions.\n\n\n\n\n4. Orientation\n\nDropping items on the left/right edge → horizontal arrangement.\n\nDropping items on the top/bottom edge → vertical arrangement.\n\n\n\n\n5. Fitting Visualizations\n\nUse Fit Entire View to ensure charts adapt to container size.\n\nUse Fixed Width/Height for consistent sizing.\n\nDistribute content evenly when you want equal column/row sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFit Entire View\nFixed Width/Height\nDistribute Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Padding\n\nInner padding: space between the container edge and content (breathing room).\n\nOuter padding: space between the container and other objects (spacing and hierarchy).\n\n\n\n\n7. Scaling Options\n\nFixed size: same size everywhere (best for presentations).\n\nRange: flexible within min–max bounds (for laptops/desktops).\n\nAutomatic: fills available space (great for responsive dashboards, but test carefully).\n\n\n\n\n8. Scrollable Dashboards\nScrollable dashboards are especially helpful for multifunctional or analytic views with many sections.\nTo create:\n\nUse a fixed height smaller than the content height (e.g., dashboard 900px tall, content 1600px).\n\nPlace content inside a vertical container — Tableau will add a vertical scroll bar.\n\nKeep key KPIs near the top; use section titles as anchors.\n\nAvoid multiple nested scroll areas.",

    "text": "Query Plan\nAs you become more familiar with SQL, you will start combining multiple SQL commands into scripts.\nWhen working with large databases—often containing millions or billions of records—it becomes essential to consider the time and cost of running those scripts.\nFor example, imagine working with a large transactional system that stores sales and product data.\nRunning a poorly optimized query on a frequently accessed table could significantly slow down reports and increase infrastructure costs. That’s why queries that run often should be optimized before being deployed.\nFaster queries mean:\n\nlower computational cost\nbetter system performance\nquicker insights for decision-makers\n\n\nWhat Is a Query Plan?\nA query plan shows how the database intends to execute a SQL query.\nMost relational database management systems (RDBMS), including PostgreSQL, can estimate:\n\nhow long a query will take\nhow many rows will be processed\nwhich operations will be performed (scans, joins, filters)\n\nTo generate a query plan, you simply add the keyword EXPLAIN before your SQL query.\nSuppose you want to retrieve all records from a sales table and understand how expensive this operation might be.\nEXPLAIN\nSELECT *\nFROM sales;\nWhen this query is executed, PostgreSQL does not return the data itself.\nInstead, it returns a query plan describing how the data would be retrieved.\nA basic query plan might look like this:\n\"Seq Scan on sales  (cost=0.00..92.00 rows=5000 width=34)\"\nThis output tells us:\n\nSeq Scan: PostgreSQL is performing a sequential scan, reading every row in the table\nsales: the table being scanned\ncost: an internal estimate of startup and total execution cost\nrows: estimated number of rows returned\nwidth: average size of each row in bytes\n\nA sequential scan is common when:\n\nthe table is relatively small\nno suitable index exists\nmost rows are expected to be returned\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTry yourself\n\n\nUnderstanding query plans helps you:\n\ndiagnose slow queries\ndecide when indexes are needed\nwrite more efficient SQL\ncommunicate performance issues to data engineers or DBAs\n\nAs datasets grow, even simple queries can become expensive.\nLearning to read and reason about query plans is a key step toward writing production-ready SQL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nQuery optimization is a huge topic, most of which goes beyond the scope of the bootcamp and the role of a data analyst. Just know that writing optimized queries is a good habit to get into, especially queries that will be executed frequently.\nIf you’d like to read more about query optimization:\n\nthis articale is a good place to start: SQL Tuning or Query Optimization\nPostgreSQL tuning\nExecution order",

    "text": "Refining Your SQL Queries\nWe have learned that reducing the cost of your queries is important.\nBut how do you actually optimize SQL queries in practice?\nOne of the simplest and most effective ways is to be precise about what data you request.\nBefore introducing additional commands, it’s worth revisiting SELECT, because it is the foundation of almost every analytical query.\n\nSELECT\nAs you already know, SELECT allows you to retrieve data from a database.\nA SELECT statement usually follows this structure:\nSELECT column_name_1,\n       column_name_2\nFROM table_name;\nIf you want to retrieve multiple columns, you list them separated by commas.\nConsider the products table:\nSELECT product_name,\n       price,\n       category\nFROM products;\nThis query tells the database to:\n\nreturn the product_name\nreturn the price\nreturn the category\nread the data from the products table\n\nOnly these three columns will be included in the result set.\n\n\nWhy Column Selection Matters?\nSelecting only the columns you actually need:\n\nreduces the amount of data transferred\nimproves query performance\nmakes results easier to read and interpret\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantTry yourself\n\n\n\nCompare the following two queries:\nEXPLAIN\nSELECT *\nFROM products;\nEXPLAIN\nSELECT product_name, price\nFROM products;\nThe second query is usually preferable when you only need product names and prices.\n\n\n\n\nORDER BY\nThe ORDER BY clause sorts query results in ascending or descending order.\nIt is commonly used when you want to view:\n\nthe first or last records\nhighest or lowest values\nalphabetically ordered text data\n\nBy default, ORDER BY sorts results in ascending order.\nSELECT column_name\nFROM table_name\nORDER BY column_name;\nYou can explicitly control the sorting direction using:\n\nASC for ascending order\nDESC for descending order\n\nSuppose you want to view products sorted by name in descending alphabetical order (Z \\(\\rightarrow\\) A).\nSELECT\n  product_name,\n  category\nFROM products\nORDER BY product_name DESC;\nThis query returns:\n\nproduct_name\ncategory\n\nsorted from Z to A, because product_name is a text (character) column.\nIf you sort a numeric column in descending order, results are ordered from largest to smallest.\nSELECT\n  product_name,\n  price\nFROM products\nORDER BY price DESC;\nThis query returns the most expensive products first.\nYou can sort by more than one column.  The database applies sorting from left to right.\nSELECT\n  product_name,\n  category,\n  price\nFROM products\nORDER BY category ASC, price DESC;\nThis means:\n\nProducts are grouped by category (A \\(\\rightarrow\\) Z)\nWithin each category, products are sorted by price (high \\(\\rightarrow\\) low)\n\nTo sum up:\n\nORDER BY is applied after SELECT and FROM\nDefault sort order is ascending\nUse DESC for reverse ordering\nText columns are sorted alphabetically\nNumeric columns are sorted by value\nMultiple columns can be combined for fine-grained control\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn the ORDER BY statment, instead of writing column names , we can simply provide its index.\nFor example:\nSELECT\n  product_name,\n  category,\n  price\nFROM products\nORDER BY 2 ASC, 3 DESC;\n\n\n\n\nLIMIT\nThe LIMIT clause restricts the number of rows returned by a query.\nIt is useful when:\n\nyou only need a small sample of the data\nyou want to preview results\nyou want to reduce query cost and execution time\n\nBasic Syntax:\nSELECT column_name\nFROM table_name\nLIMIT number_of_rows;\nThe value provided to LIMIT must always be a number.\nExample:\nSuppose you want to retrieve product names and prices, sorted by price from highest to lowest, but you only care about the top 10 most expensive products.\nSELECT\n  product_name,\n  price\nFROM products\nORDER BY price DESC\nLIMIT 10;\nThis query:\n\nsorts products by price in descending order\nreturns only the first 10 rows\n\nUsing LIMIT in this way saves time and computational resources, especially when working with large tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\nLIMIT is always written at the end of a query\nit must be placed after ORDER BY (if present)\nthe value must be numeric\n\nIf LIMIT is placed elsewhere in the query, PostgreSQL will return an error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDatabase Compatibility Note\n\n\n\nNot all SQL databases use LIMIT.\n\nPostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite \\(\\rightarrow\\) LIMIT\nSQL Server \\(\\rightarrow\\) TOP\n\n\n\n\n\nGROUP BY\nThe GROUP BY clause is very popular among data analysts :)\nThe GROUP BY clause allows you to group rows that share the same values in one or more columns.\nIt is commonly used together with aggregate functions to summarize data.\nSimilar to Excel, SQL provides several aggregate functions that allow you to perform calculations across multiple rows of data.\nBelow is a list of commonly used aggregate functions.\nNote that SUM and AVG can only be applied to numeric columns.\n\nCOUNT() counts the number of rows\nMAX() finds the maximum value in a column\nMIN() finds the minimum value in a column\nSUM() adds up all numeric values in a column\nAVG() calculates the average of numeric values in a column\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe are going to learn more functions later.\n\n\n\nExample | Grouping Sales by Product\nSuppose you want to calculate total sales per product.\nSELECT\n  product_id,\n  SUM(total_sales) AS total_revenue\nFROM sales\nGROUP BY product_id;\nThis query:\n\ngroups rows by product_id\ncalculates total revenue per product\nreturns one row per product\n\n\n\nKey Rules for GROUP BY\n\nEvery column in SELECT must either:\n\nappear in the GROUP BY clause, or\nbe wrapped in an aggregate function\n\nGROUP BY is evaluated after WHERE and before ORDER BY\n\n\n\nExample | Grouping with Sorting and Limiting\nSELECT\n  product_id,\n  SUM(total_sales) AS total_revenue\nFROM sales\nGROUP BY product_id\nORDER BY total_revenue DESC\nLIMIT 5;\nThis query returns the top 5 products by total revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nLIMIT controls how many rows are returned\nGROUP BY controls how rows are aggregated\nBoth are essential tools for efficient, scalable data analysis\nThey are often used together in real-world analytical queries\n\n\n\n\n\nExample | Discovering Distinct Values\nGROUP BY can also be used to identify distinct values in a column.\nThis is useful when you want to understand how data is organized without seeing every individual row.\nTo see all product categories in the database, you could start with:\nSELECT \n  category\nFROM products;\nThis query returns the category for every product, which may include many duplicates. If you only want to know which categories exist, GROUP BY is the right tool.\nSELECT \n  category,\n  COUNT(*)\nFROM products\nGROUP BY category;\nThis query:\n\ngroups rows by category\nreturns one row per unique category\nremoves duplicate category values from the output\n\nThe result is a concise summary of the different product categories stored in the database.\nUsing GROUP BY in this way helps you:\n\nexplore the structure of a dataset\nvalidate categorical columns\nprepare data for aggregation and reporting\n\nIn practice, GROUP BY becomes even more powerful when combined with aggregate functions, which you’ll explore next.\n\n\nExample | Sales per Pruduct\nAggregate functions are most powerful when combined with GROUP BY, which allows you to summarize data across categories. Suppose you are working with a sales department and want to understand how many sales transactions exist per product.\nTo begin, recall that the sales table may contain many rows per product.\nSELECT\n  product_id,\n  COUNT(transaction_id) AS number_of_transactions\nFROM sales\nGROUP BY product_id;\nThis query:\n\ngroups rows by product_id\ncounts how many transactions exist for each product\nreturns one row per product\n\n\n\nExample | Total Revenue per Product\nYou can also summarize numeric columns such as total revenue.\nSELECT\n  product_id,\n  SUM(total_sales) AS total_revenue\nFROM sales\nGROUP BY product_id;\nHere:\n\nSUM(total_sales) adds up all sales values per product\nthe result shows total revenue generated by each product\n\n\n\nExample | Average Price by Category\nAggregate functions are often used for higher-level analysis.\nSELECT\n  category,\n  AVG(price) AS average_price\nFROM products\nGROUP BY category;\nThis query:\n\ngroups products by category\ncalculates the average price within each category\n\n\n\nGROUP BY with Multiple Columns\nYou can also group data by multiple columns.\nTo do this, simply list all grouping columns after GROUP BY, separated by commas.\nThis allows you to create more granular summaries by combining multiple dimensions.\n\nExample | Grouping by Multiple Attributes\nSuppose you want to understand how many sales transactions exist for each product and employee_id (later we will get the employee name) combination.\nSELECT\n  product_id,\n  COUNT(transaction_id) AS transaction_count\nFROM sales\nGROUP BY product_id\nORDER BY COUNT(transaction_id) DESC;\nThis query:\n\ngroups records by both product_id and employee_id\ncounts the number of transactions in each combination\nreturns one row per unique (product_id, employee_id) pair\n\nThe output represents:\n\none row per product and employee combination\nthe total number of transactions for that specific combination\n\nGrouping by multiple columns helps you:\n\nanalyze performance across multiple dimensions\nbreak down metrics by category, region, channel, or time\nbuild detailed summaries for dashboards and reports\n\nYou will get more practice using multi-column GROUP BY as you move into data summarization, aggregation, and data cleaning tasks later in the course.\n\n\n\n\nDISTINCT\nThe DISTINCT keyword is used to return unique values from a column or a combination of columns.\nIt is especially useful when a dataset contains duplicate values and you want to understand the unique categories or combinations present in the data.\nSyntax\nSELECT DISTINCT column_name\nFROM table_name;\n\nExample | Finding Unique Values\nSuppose you want to see all unique product categories in the products table.\nSELECT DISTINCT category\nFROM products;\nThis query returns one row per unique category, even if multiple products belong to the same category.\n\n\nDISTINCT with Multiple Columns\nDISTINCT can also be applied to multiple columns to find unique combinations.\nFor example, to find unique combinations of product category and price:\nSELECT DISTINCT\n  category,\n  price\nFROM products;\nThis returns each unique (category, price) pair found in the table.\n\n\nDISTINCT with COUNT\nSELECT DISTINCT\n  COUNT(category),\n  COUNT(DISTINCT category)\nFROM products;\n\n\nDISTINCT vs GROUP BY\nIn many cases, DISTINCT and GROUP BY can produce the same result when no aggregate functions are used.\nUsing DISTINCT:\nSELECT DISTINCT\n  category,\n  price\nFROM products;\nUsing GROUP BY:\nSELECT\n  category,\n  price\nFROM products\nGROUP BY category, price;\nBoth queries return the unique combinations of category and price.\n\n\nWhen to Use DISTINCT\nUse DISTINCT when:\n\nyou only need unique values\nno aggregation is required\nyou want simpler, more readable SQL\n\nUse GROUP BY when:\n\nyou need aggregate functions\nyou want more control over grouping logic\n\n\n\n\nGROUP BY vs DISTINCT\nWhich command do you think is faster: GROUP BY or DISTINCT?\nUse EXPLAIN to generate query plans for both queries and compare their estimated costs to see which one runs more efficiently in PostgreSQL.\n\n\nHAVING\n\nWhy HAVING Exists\nThe HAVING clause is designed to filter aggregated results.\nIn analytical queries, data is often grouped and summarized before it becomes meaningful.\nAt that stage, row-level filtering is no longer sufficient.\nHAVING fills this gap.\n\nWHERE \\(\\rightarrow\\) filters rows before aggregation\nHAVING \\(\\rightarrow\\) filters groups after aggregation\n\nUnderstanding this distinction is essential for correct and efficient SQL.\n\n\nWHERE vs HAVING\nThink of SQL execution as a pipeline.\n\nraw rows are first filtered\nrows are then grouped\naggregates are calculated\ngroups are filtered again if needed\n\nThis leads to a clear separation of responsibilities:\n\nWHERE \\(\\rightarrow\\) row-level filtering\nGROUP BY \\(\\rightarrow\\) aggregation\nHAVING \\(\\rightarrow\\) group-level filtering\n\n\n\nLogical Query Execution Order\nAlthough SQL is written top-down, it is executed in a different logical order.\nAt a high level:\n\nFROM\nWHERE\nGROUP BY\nHAVING\nSELECT\nORDER BY\nLIMIT\n\nThis order explains why aggregate functions cannot appear in WHERE, but are allowed in HAVING.\n\n\nBasic HAVING Syntax\nA typical query using HAVING looks like this:\nSELECT\n  group_column,\n  AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column)\nFROM table_name\nGROUP BY group_column\nHAVING AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column) condition;\nImportant points:\n\nHAVING is evaluated after aggregation\nit almost always appears together with GROUP BY\nit works on aggregated values, not raw rows\n\n\n\n\nHAVING Example | Filtering by Total Revenue\nSuppose you want to identify products that generated more than 10,000 in total revenue.\nSELECT\n  product_id,\n  SUM(total_sales) AS total_revenue\nFROM sales\nGROUP BY product_id\nHAVING SUM(total_sales) &gt; 10000;\nThis query:\n\ngroups sales by product\ncalculates total revenue per product\nkeeps only products above the revenue threshold\n\n\n\nHAVING vs WHERE — Common Mistake\nUsing WHERE with aggregate functions is not allowed.\nIncorrect example:\nSELECT\n  product_id,\n  SUM(total_sales)\nFROM sales\nWHERE SUM(total_sales) &gt; 10000\nGROUP BY product_id;\nThis fails because SUM(total_sales) does not exist at the WHERE stage of execution.\n\n\n\nCombining WHERE and HAVING\nIn real-world analytical queries, WHERE and HAVING are often used together.\nTheir roles are complementary:\n\nWHERE removes unnecessary rows early\nHAVING applies business rules after aggregation\n\nSELECT\n  product_id,\n  SUM(total_sales) AS total_revenue\nFROM sales\nWHERE total_sales &gt; 0\nGROUP BY product_id\nHAVING SUM(total_sales) &gt; 10000;\nThis approach is usually more efficient than relying on HAVING alone.\n\n\n\nHAVING with COUNT\nHAVING is frequently used with COUNT().\nExample: find products with at least 50 transactions.\nSELECT\n  product_id,\n  COUNT(transaction_id) AS transaction_count\nFROM sales\nGROUP BY product_id\nHAVING COUNT(transaction_id) &gt;= 50;\nHere:\n\ntransactions are grouped by product\nonly frequently sold products are retained\n\n\n\n\nHAVING with Multiple Conditions\nMultiple aggregate conditions can be combined using logical operators.\nSELECT\n  product_id,\n  COUNT(transaction_id) AS transaction_count,\n  SUM(total_sales) AS total_revenue\nFROM sales\nGROUP BY product_id\nHAVING\n  COUNT(transaction_id) &gt;= 50\n  AND SUM(total_sales) &gt; 10000;\nThis allows you to enforce compound business rules at the group level.\n\n\n\nWhen to Use HAVING\nUse HAVING when:\n\nfiltering aggregated results\napplying thresholds to groups\nworking with SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, or MAX\n\nDo not use HAVING when row-level filtering with WHERE is sufficient.",

Sales per Customer\nA common analytical use case is average behavior per entity.\nSELECT\n  customer_name,\n  AVG(total_sales) AS avg_transaction_value\nFROM sales_analysis\nGROUP BY customer_name;\nThis answers questions such as:\n\nwhat is the typical transaction value per customer?\nwho are high-value vs low-value customers?\n\n\n\n\nAnalytical Interpretation | When AVG() Is Appropriate\nUse AVG() when:\n\ndata is symmetrically distributed\nextreme values are rare\nyou want a representative “typical” value\n\nTypical examples:\n\naverage order value\n\naverage discount rate\n\naverage price per category\n\n\n\n\nAnalytical Limitation | Sensitivity to Outliers\nAVG() is highly sensitive to outliers.\nExample scenario\n\n\n\ntotal_sales\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n25\n\n\n30\n\n\n500\n\n\n\nThe average is pulled upward by a single extreme value.\nIn such cases, the average may misrepresent typical behavior.\n\n\n\nAVG() vs Median | Conceptual Note\n\nAVG() reflects the mean\nthe median reflects the middle value\n\nUse:\n\nAVG → for stable, normally distributed data\n\nMedian → for skewed data or income-like variables\n\nMedian calculations will be covered later in the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningAnalytical Warning | Always Check the Distribution\n\n\n\nBefore relying on AVG(), consider:\n\npresence of outliers\n\nskewness of the data\n\nwhether “typical” behavior is meaningful\n\nBlindly using averages is one of the most common analytical mistakes.\n\n\n\n\nAnalytical Use Cases\n\naverage order value\n\naverage discount per transaction\n\naverage price by category\n\nbenchmarking typical performance\n\n\n\nAVG() computes the arithmetic mean\n\nNULL values are ignored by default\n\ngrouping enables per-dimension averages\n\naverages are sensitive to outliers\n\ndistribution shape matters for interpretation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nUnderstanding when not to use AVG() is just as important as knowing how to write it.\n\n\n\n\n\nMIN() and MAX()\nMIN() and MAX() are aggregate functions used to identify extreme values in a dataset.\nThey answer the questions:\n\nWhat is the smallest value?\nWhat is the largest value?\n\nThese functions are widely used in exploratory analysis, data validation, and boundary checks.\n\n\nMIN() and MAX() | Basic Aggregation\nMIN() returns the lowest value, and MAX() returns the highest value in a

also work on text (string) columns.\nFor text values:\n\nMIN() returns the alphabetically first value\n\nMAX() returns the alphabetically last value\n\nInput\n\n\n\nproduct_name\n\n\n\n\nCable\n\n\nMouse\n\n\nKeyboard\n\n\n\n\\[\\downarrow\\]\nSELECT\n  MIN(product_name) AS first_product,\n  MAX(product_name) AS last_product\nFROM

outliers\n\na single abnormal value can dominate the result\n\nAlways pair extremes with other statistics such as:\n\nAVG()\n\nCOUNT()\n\ndistribution analysis\n\nto get a complete picture.\n\nMIN() and MAX() are essential tools for understanding the limits of your data, but they should never be used in isolation.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOUNT()\nCOUNT() is one of the most fundamental SQL aggregate functions.\nIt is used to measure volume, cardinality, and data completeness.\nUnlike SUM() or AVG(), COUNT() does not depend on numeric magnitude.\nIt answers a simpler—but critically important—question:\n\nHow many rows or values exist?\n\nIn analytics, incorrect use of COUNT() is a common source of silent errors, especially when NULLs or duplicates are involved.\n\n\nCOUNT() | Basic Row Counting\nCOUNT(*) counts the number of rows returned by a query.\nInput\n\n\n\ntransaction_id\ndiscount\n\n\n\n\n1001\n0.10\n\n\n1002\nNULL\n\n\n1003\n0.20\n\n\n\n\\[\\downarrow\\]\nSELECT\n  COUNT(*) AS total_rows\nFROM

SQL.\n\n\n\nCOUNT(DISTINCT) | Counting Unique Values\nCOUNT(DISTINCT column) counts the number of unique, non-NULL values.\nSELECT\n  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_name) AS unique_customers\nFROM sales_analysis;\nThis answers questions like:\n\nhow many unique customers exist?\nhow many unique products were sold?\n\n\n\n\nCOUNT(DISTINCT) with GROUP BY | Unique Entities per Group\nSELECT\n  city,\n  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_name) AS unique_customers\nFROM sales_analysis\nGROUP BY city;\nThis pattern is commonly used for:\n\nmarket reach analysis\ncustomer distribution by geography\npenetration metrics\n\n\n\n\nCOUNT() for Duplicate Detection\nDuplicates are detected using COUNT() together with GROUP BY and HAVING.\nExample | Duplicate Transactions\nSELECT\n  transaction_id,\n  COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count\nFROM sales_analysis\nGROUP BY transaction_id\nHAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1;\nAny returned row indicates a duplicate transaction ID.\n\n\n\nCOUNT() and NULL Values | Key Rules\n\nCOUNT(*) counts rows, including those with NULLs\nCOUNT(column) ignores NULLs\nCOUNT(DISTINCT column) ignores NULLs and duplicates\nif all values are NULL, COUNT(column) returns 0\n\nUnderstanding these rules is essential for correct metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningAnalytical Warning | Define What You Are Counting\n\n\n\nBefore using COUNT(), always ask:\n\nam I counting rows or entities?\ndo I need DISTINCT?\nis the table grain aligned with my question?\n\nCounting the wrong thing leads to misleading KPIs even when SQL syntax is correct.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytical Use Cases\n\nnumber of transactions\nnumber of customers\ndata completeness checks\nduplicate detection\ndenominator for rates and averages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMastering COUNT() is a prerequisite for trustworthy analytical SQL.\n\n\n\n\n\nRow-Level Arithmetic\nRow-level arithmetic refers to calculations performed on each individual row of a table.\nUnlike aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT), these operations do not reduce rows, istead they create derived columns.\nRow-level arithmetic is foundational for:\n\nfeature engineering\n\nrevenue and cost calculations\n\nmetric normalization\n\npreparing data for aggregation\n\nIn practice, most analytical pipelines combine row-level calculations first, followed by aggregation.\n\n\nBasic Calculation\nA common example is calculating revenue at the transaction level.\nInput\n\n\n\ntransaction_id\nquantity\nprice\n\n\n\n\n1001\n2\n25.00\n\n\n1002\n1\n80.00\n\n\n\n\\[\\downarrow\\]\nSELECT\n  transaction_id,\n  quantity

producing a new derived value.\n\n\nCombining Multiple Columns\nYou can combine more than two columns in a single expression.\nInput\n\n\n\ntransaction_id\nquantity\nprice\ndiscount\n\n\n\n\n1001\n2\n25.00\n0.10\n\n\n1002\n1\n80.00\n0.00\n\n\n\n\\[\\downarrow\\]\nSELECT\n  transaction_id,\n  quantity * price * (1 - discount) AS net_revenue\nFROM sales_analysis;\n\\[\\downarrow\\]\n\n\n\ntransaction_id\nnet_revenue\n\n\n\n\n1001\n45.00\n\n\n1002\n80.00\n\n\n\nThis pattern is common in pricing, discounting, and billing logic.\n\n\nOrder of Operations\nSQL follows standard arithmetic precedence:\n\nparentheses\n\nmultiplication and division\n\naddition and subtraction\n\nUse parentheses to make calculations explicit and readable.\nSELECT\n  transaction_id,\n  (quantity * price) - (quantity * price * discount) AS net_revenue\nFROM sales_analysis;\nThis is equivalent to the previous example but often clearer in business contexts.\n\n\n\nNumeric Transformations\nRow-level arithmetic is often combined with numeric functions such as ROUND, CEILING, or FLOOR.\nSELECT\n  transaction_id,\n  ROUND(quantity * price, 2) AS rounded_revenue\nFROM sales_analysis;\nThis is especially important for financial reporting.\n\n\n\nRow-Level Arithmetic vs Aggregation\nIt is critical to distinguish between:\n\nrow-level calculations → preserve rows\n\naggregate calculations → reduce rows\n\nSELECT\n  SUM(quantity * price) AS total_revenue\nFROM sales_analysis;\nHere:\n\nquantity * price is computed per row\nSUM() aggregates those results into a single value\n\nThis pattern—calculate first, aggregate second—is a core analytical principle.\n\n\nCommon Analytical Use Cases\n\ntransaction-level revenue\n\nnet revenue after discounts\n\ncost per unit\n\nmargin calculations\n\nnormalized metrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningAnalytical Warning | Check NULL Propagation\n\n\n\nIn arithmetic expressions:\n\nif any operand is NULL, the result is NULL\nthis can silently remove rows from later aggregations\n\nUnderstanding NULL behavior is essential and will be revisited in a dedicated NULL-handling chapter.\n\nRow-level arithmetic is the bridge between raw data and meaningful analytical metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\nCEILING() and FLOOR()\nCEILING() and FLOOR() are numeric functions used to round values to integer boundaries.\n\nCEILING() rounds a value up to the nearest integer\n\nFLOOR() rounds a value down to the nearest integer\n\nThese functions are commonly used for:\n\nthreshold logic\nrange construction\ndistribution analysis\n\n\nThresholds and Ranges\nInput\n\n\n\ntransaction_id\ntotal_sales\n\n\n\n\n1001\n120.10\n\n\n1002\n80.90\n\n\n\n\\[\\downarrow\\]\nSELECT\n  transaction_id,\n  CEILING(total_sales) AS rounded_up,\n  FLOOR(total_sales)

must meet a minimum threshold\nFLOOR() is useful when values must not exceed a maximum threshold\n\n\n\n\nAnalytical Use Cases\n\nbilling thresholds (minimum chargeable units)\n\nrounding prices or quantities for operational rules\n\nconstructing numeric ranges\n\ndiscretizing continuous values\n\n\n\nCEILING() with GROUP BY | Revenue Ranges\nCEILING() can be used to group continuous numeric values into fixed-width ranges, which is a common technique in exploratory and descriptive analytics.\nIn this example, transaction revenues are grouped into 50-unit revenue ranges.\n\nInput (sales_analysis — simplified view)\n\n\n\ntransaction_id\ntotal_sales\n\n\n\n\n1001\n12.40\n\n\n1002\n47.80\n\n\n1003\n52.10\n\n\n1004\n79.90\n\n\n1005\n101.25\n\n\n1006\n138.60\n\n\n\n\nStep 1 | Range Assignment Logic\nThe expression below assigns each row to a range:\n\\[\n\\text{revenue\\_range} = \\lceil \\frac{\\text{total\\_sales}}{50} \\rceil \\times 50\n\\]\nThis means:\n\nvalues from 0 &lt; x ≤ 50 → range 50\nvalues from 50 &lt; x ≤ 100 → range 100\nvalues from 100 &lt; x ≤ 150 → range 150\n\n\nQuery\nSELECT\n  CEILING(total_sales / 50.0) * 50 AS revenue_range,\n  COUNT(*) AS

to Interpret the Output\nEach row represents a revenue range, not individual transactions.\nFor example:\n\nrevenue_range = 100 represents all transactions where\n\\[50 &lt; \\text{total\\_sales} \\le 100\\]\ntransactions shows how many transactions fall into that range\ntotal_revenue shows the sum of sales within the range\n\n\n\n\nAnalytical Use Cases\n\ndistribution analysis\n\nrevenue concentration analysis\n\nidentifying dominant transaction ranges\n\npreparing binned metrics for dashboards\n\nexploratory analysis before modeling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningAnalytical Warning | Ranges Are Design Choices\n\n\n\nRanges created with CEILING() or FLOOR() are analytical assumptions.\n\ndifferent range widths lead to different interpretations\n\noverly wide ranges hide structure\n\noverly narrow ranges introduce noise\n\nAlways justify:\n\nrange size\n\nboundary logic\n\nbusiness meaning\n\n\n\nCEILING() combined with GROUP BY is a powerful technique for turning continuous numeric data into interpretable analytical summaries, but its effectiveness depends on thoughtful range design.\n\n\n\nCOALESCE()\nCOALESCE() is a SQL function used for explicit NULL handling.\nIt replaces NULL values with a specified substitute, allowing you to control how missing data is treated before aggregation or analysis.\nHandling NULL values explicitly is a critical analytical step, because different substitution strategies lead to different interpretations and KPIs.\nCommon strategies include:\n\nreplacing NULL with 0\nreplacing NULL with the average\nreplacing NULL with the median\n\nEach choice has distinct analytical implications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBy default, most aggregate functions ignore NULL values.\nCOALESCE() lets you override this behavior intentionally.\n\n\n\nCOALESCE() with Zero | Treat Missing as Zero\nUse this approach only when business logic clearly defines NULL as zero,\nfor example:\n\nno discount applied\nno quantity sold\nno activity recorded\n\nInput\n\n\n\ntransaction_id\ndiscount\n\n\n\n\n1001\n0.10\n\n\n1002\nNULL\n\n\n1003\n0.20\n\n\n\n\\[\\downarrow\\]\nSELECT\n  AVG(COALESCE(discount, 0)) AS

means zero impact\nKPIs explicitly require zero inclusion\noperational metrics (counts, volumes)\n\n\n\n\nCOALESCE() with Average | Mean Imputation\nIn this approach, missing values are replaced with the overall average.\nThis preserves the mean level of the data but reduces variability, since all missing values become identical.\n\\[\\downarrow\\]\nSELECT\n  AVG(COALESCE(discount, avg_discount))

    "section": "What is a Database",
    "text": "What is a Database\nA database is a collection of stored data, usually organized in tables of rows and columns and managed by a database management system (DBMS). Analysts collectively refer to the data, the DBMS, and other related tools as the database.\nWhile there are several ways to store data in a database, the most common approach is to store the data in columns and rows. The intersection of each column and row is called a cell, and each cell represents a data element.\nA Data element could be:\n\nnumeric:\ntext\nyou name it… \n\nTable: Example of rows, columns, and a highlighted cell\n\n\n\n\nCol A\nCol B\nCol C\n\n\n\n\nRow 1\nA1\nB1\nC1\n\n\nRow 2\nA2\nB2 (Cell)\nC2\n\n\nRow 3\nA3\nB3\nC3\n\n\n\nCell = intersection of Row 2 and Column B → B2.\n\nSpreadsheets vs. Databases\nDatabases differ from spreadsheets (excel-like tools) in several important ways, particularly in scalability, performance, and the ability to support multiple users. The key distinctions include:\n\nUser Access\n\nSpreadsheets are typically designed for single-user access.\nDatabases allow multiple users to access and manipulate the data simultaneously.\n\nData Capacity\n\nSpreadsheets handle relatively small datasets (usually up to a few hundred thousand rows).\nDatabases can efficiently store and process millions or even billions of records.\n\nPerformance\n\nSpreadsheets load the entire dataset into memory when opened.\nDatabases retrieve only the necessary records, improving speed and scalability.\n\nQuery Capability\n\nSpreadsheets require manual filtering, sorting, and counting.\nDatabases allow precise and fast queries using SQL.\n\n\nTo illustrate the difference, consider the following dataset of actors stored in a database table:\nTable: Example of Actor Records in a Database\n\n\n\nactor_id\nfirst_name\nlast_name\nlast_update\n\n\n\n\n1\nPenelope\nGuiness\n2013-05-26 14:47:57.62\n\n\n2\nNick\nWahlberg\n2013-05-26 14:47:57.62\n\n\n3\nEd\nChase\n2013-05-26 14:47:57.62\n\n\n4\nJennifer\nDavis\n2013-05-26 14:47:57.62\n\n\n5\nJohnny\nLollobrigida\n2013-05-26 14:47:57.62\n\n\n\n\nSpreadsheet vs. Database Workflow\nWhen performing tasks such as counting how many actors have the first name “Ed”, the difference between spreadsheets and databases becomes clear:\n\nUsing a Spreadsheet:\n\nYou must manually filter the first_name column to show only rows containing “Ed.”\nAfter filtering, you manually count the matching rows or read the count displayed by the spreadsheet application.\nWith large datasets, loading, filtering, and recalculating can be slow and resource-intensive, causing delays and potential crashes.\nSpreadsheets can process only one query at a time, limiting efficiency.\n\nUsing a Database\n\nInstead of loading the entire dataset, you can execute a single SQL query such as:\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM actor\nWHERE first_name = 'Ed';\nThe result is returned almost instantly, even with very large datasets.\nDatabases support multiple users running queries simultaneously without performance degradation.\nThey are optimized for complex, concurrent data manipulation and retrieval, making them more suitable for scalable and shared environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOverall, spreadsheets may be adequate for small, single-user datasets, but databases provide far superior performance, scalability, and efficiency when working with larger datasets or multiple users.\n\n\n\n\nSpreadsheets vs. Databases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPREADSHEET\nDATABASE\n\n\n\n\nDesigned for single-user access\nDesigned for multiple-user access\n\n\nOnly one user can manipulate the data at one point in time\nMultiple users can manipulate the data at one point in time\n\n\nHandles a limited amount of data\nHandles small to massive amounts of data\n\n\nBasic to moderate data operations\nBasic to complex data operations\n\n\nSlow or unable to manipulate, extract, transform, and aggregate large amounts of data\nFaster to manipulate, extract, transform, and aggregate large amounts of data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructured vs Unstructured Data\nBefore we learn about different types of databases, we should understand the distinction between them. Broadly speaking, these below terms refer to how data is organized:\n\nstructured\nunstructured\nsemi-structured data.\n\n\nStructured Data\nEach row in the table represents a distinct entity (in this case, an actor), while each column corresponds to a specific attribute such as the actor’s first name. The intersection of a row and a column forms a cell, and each cell contains a single data value.\nImportantly, every column is assigned a predefined data type, which determines the kind of information it can store. For example, the first_name column uses a text data type, meaning all values in this column must consist of alphabetical characters only.\n\nSample Data\n\n\n\nactor_id\nfirst_name\nlast_name\nlast_update\n\n\n\n\n1\nPenelope\nGuiness\n2013-05-26 14:47:57.62\n\n\n2\nNick\nWahlberg\n2013-05-26 14:47:57.62\n\n\n3\nEd\nChase\n2013-05-26 14:47:57.62\n\n\n4\nJennifer\nDavis\n2013-05-26 14:47:57.62\n\n\n5\nJohnny\nLollobrigida\n2013-05-26 14:47:57.62\n\n\n6\nBette\nNicholson\n2013-05-26 14:47:57.62\n\n\n7\nGrace\nMostel\n2013-05-26 14:47:57.62\n\n\n8\nMatthew\nJohansson\n2013-05-26 14:47:57.62\n\n\n9\nJoe\nSwank\n2013-05-26 14:47:57.62\n\n\n10\nChristian\nGable\n2013-05-26 14:47:57.62\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnstructured Data\nUnstructured data refers to information that does not follow a predefined model or tabular format. Unlike structured data, it has no fixed rows, columns, or consistent organization. Common examples include:\n\nEmails\n\nText messages\n\nImages and graphics\n\nAudio and video files\n\nBecause it lacks a clear structure, unstructured data is more difficult to search, process, and analyze. Extracting useful information often requires significant manual effort or specialized tools. It can be compared to searching for every instance of a specific word in a book—possible, but time-consuming and inefficient without the right indexing or processing methods.\n\n\n\nSemi-Structured Data\nSemi-structured data lies between structured and unstructured data. While it does not follow a rigid tabular format, it still maintains a discernible organizational framework, making it more flexible than strictly structured data.\nThis type of data can be analyzed effectively only when you understand the organizational rules embedded within it. A common example is HTML: although it is not stored in rows and columns, it contains predictable tags and nested elements that define the structure of the information. To locate specific content within an HTML file, you must first understand what each tag represents.\nSemi-structured data therefore offers:\n\nMore flexibility than structured tables\n\nMore organization than raw unstructured content\n\nBetter adaptability for evolving or complex data formats\n\n\n\nExamples of Each Data Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nStructured Data\nCustomer tables, sales transactions, employee records, relational database tables (SQL).\n\n\nUnstructured Data\nEmails, PDFs, text documents, social media posts, images, videos, audio recordings.\n\n\nSemi-Structured Data\nHTML documents, JSON files, XML files, log files, key–value store outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntro to SQL\nSQL (Structured Query Language) was first developed by IBM in the early 1970s and released publicly in 1979. It was later standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), establishing it as the primary language for interacting with relational databases.\nSQL is used for three core tasks:\n\nManipulating Data: inserting, updating, or deleting records within a database.\nSearching Data: retrieving all films that feature a specific actor (e.g., Ed Chase).\nDefining Database Structures: For instance, creating new tables or adding columns to existing ones.\n\nLike any language, SQL follows specific syntax rules.\n\nAn English sentence ends with a period.\n\nA SQL statement ends with a semicolon (;).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhile the foundational syntax is consistent, slight variations may occur depending on the database system (e.g., PostgreSQL vs. SQL Server). Understanding these conventions is essential before writing your own SQL queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIs SQL a Programing Language?\n\n\n\nSQL generally counts as code even though it’s not technically a programming language. You’ll encounter a common phenomenon when you start working with it—you’ll find yourself in situations where you can’t solve a coding problem using only your existing knowledge. Don’t worry—this happens to all beginners, and it’s something you’ll have to learn to deal with.\nMost coders spend a fair amount of time researching answers to their problems online. There’s no need to get frustrated if you run into a brick wall—simply Google what you’re trying to achieve in SQL (or any other language), and you may be surprised how quickly you’ll find an answer to your problem!\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Databases\nAs you learn about SQL, you’ll be working with a relational database, a common type of database that all analysts need to be familiar with. That said, relational databases aren’t the only type of database out there. Let’s look at the most important ones and their defining features:\n\nRelational Databases\nNoSQL Databases\nGraph Databases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabases could also be centralized or distributed.\nDatabases could also be online analytical processing (OLAP) or online transaction processing (OLTP) system.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelational Databases\nA relational database is a collection of data stored in one or more tables of rows and columns.\nBetween the different tables, there are links, known as relationships. As you’ve already learned, data analysts use SQL to query and manipulate the data in relational databases.\n\nPopular relational database management systems (RDBMS) include Microsoft SQL Server,MySQL, Oracle DB and PostgreSQL. Each of these RDBMS is owned by different companies:\n\nPostgreSQL: PostgreSQL Community\nMySQL: Oracle\nOracle: Oracle\nMSSQL: Microsoft\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nPostgreSQL\nSQL Server\nOracle\nMySQL\n\n\n\n\nLicense\nOpen-source\nCommercial + Express\nCommercial\nOpen-source (Oracle-owned)\n\n\nOS Support\nLinux, macOS, Windows\nWindows, Linux\nLinux, Unix, Windows\nLinux, Windows\n\n\nStrengths\nStandards compliant, JSONB, extensible\nEnterprise BI, T-SQL, Microsoft ecosystem\nScalability, security, enterprise features\nFast reads, simple web workloads\n\n\nBest Use Cases\nAnalytics, complex apps, data science\nBI, ERP, corporate apps\nFinance, telecom, large enterprises\nWeb apps, lightweight services\n\n\n\n\n\nNoSQL Databases\n\nNoSQL stands for Not Only SQL and refers to database systems that are generally non-relational, designed for flexible schemas and distributed workloads.\nSome NoSQL systems provide SQL-like query interfaces, but they do not follow the relational model.\n\nUnlike relational databases, NoSQL databases have a flexible data model, and they’re used to store unstructured, semi-structured, and even structured data. In general, you wouldn’t use SQL to access a NoSQL database, though some have SQL-like languages.\nAs web applications have become more complex, NoSQL databases have become popular thanks to their flexibility. NoSQL databases are used for applications that change frequently as new functions and features are added; for instance, the social networking site LinkedIn uses a NoSQL database.\nThus, NoSQL databases are non-relational systems designed for scalability, flexibility, and high-volume data. They fall into several major categories depending on their data model.\n\nKey–Value Databases\n\nConcept: Simple key → value storage.\nPopular systems: Redis, Amazon DynamoDB, Riak KV\nExample (Redis):\n\n{\n  'course':'Data Analytics',\n  'company':'ACA'\n}\n\n\n\n\nDocument Databases\n\nConcept: JSON-like documents with flexible schema.\nPopular systems: MongoDB, CouchDB, Firestore\nExample (MongoDB):\n\n{\n  \"user_id\": 1001,\n  \"name\": \"Maria\",\n  \"roles\": [\"admin\", \"manager\"]\n}\n\n\n\n\nColumn-Family (Wide-Column) Databases\n\nConcept: Data stored in column families across distributed nodes.\nPopular systems: Apache Cassandra, HBase, ScyllaDB\nExample (Cassandra CQL):\n\nINSERT INTO users (user_id, name, age)\nVALUES (1001, 'Maria', 33);\n\n\n\n\nGraph Databases\n\nConcept: Nodes and relationships.\nPopular systems: Neo4j, ArangoDB, Amazon Neptune\nExample (Neo4j Cypher):\n\nCREATE (u:User {name: \"Maria\"})\nCREATE (p:Project {title: \"Analytics App\"})\nCREATE (u)-[:LEADS]-&gt;(p);\n\n\n\n\nTime-Series Databases\n\nConcept: Optimized for timestamped metrics.\nPopular systems: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, Prometheus\nExample (InfluxDB Line Protocol):\n\n\nMostly used among DevOps for monitoring  —\n\n\nSearch Engine Databases\n\nConcept: Full-text indexing and search.\nPopular systems: Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Apache Solr\nExample (Elasticsearch Query):\n\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match\": {\n      \"message\": \"database error\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nMostly used for querying logs\n\n\n\n\nSummary Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoSQL Type\nKey Concept\nPopular Databases\n\n\n\n\nKey–Value\nKey → Value lookups\nRedis, DynamoDB, Riak\n\n\nDocument\nJSON-like documents\nMongoDB, CouchDB, Firestore\n\n\nColumn-Family\nWide-column storage\nCassandra, HBase, ScyllaDB\n\n\nGraph\nNodes + edges\nNeo4j, ArangoDB, Amazon Neptune\n\n\nTime-Series\nTime-stamped metrics\nInfluxDB, TimescaleDB, Prometheus\n\n\nSearch Engine\nText search and indexing\nElasticsearch, OpenSearch, Solr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneReading\n\n\n\nSQL vs NoSQL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentralized vs Distributed Databases\nThe three kinds of databases discussed above can be centralized or distributed. Put simply, these concepts refer to where the database is stored.\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of centralized vs distributed databases\n\n\n\n\nCentralized Databases\nA centralized database runs on a single machine (single-node). All users, analysts, and administrators connect to this one server.\nKey Features:\n\nAll data lives in one powerful machine.\nEasy to manage and maintain.\nCan handle billions of records and terabytes of data.\nScaling requires buying larger, more expensive hardware (vertical scaling).\nOnce the system reaches hardware limits, performance and management become challenging.\n\nCommon in: Traditional enterprises, internal IT systems, on-premise setups.\nAnalogy: A workstation or laptop, but with high-end server specifications.\n\n\n\nDistributed Databases\nA distributed database stores data across multiple machines (nodes). These nodes work together to form one logical database.\n\nKey Features:\n\nDesigned for massive-scale data.\nScales horizontally by adding more machines.\nFaster data access and search due to parallel processing.\nMore cost-effective storage.\nHigher availability and fault tolerance.\n\n\n\nCommon in:\n\nBanking systems\n\nTelecommunications\n\nLarge tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix)\n\n\n\nWhy it’s used?\nTo handle constantly growing data, high query loads, global users, and real-time applications.\n\n\n\nCentralized vs Distributed Databases: Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nCentralized Database\nDistributed Database\n\n\n\n\nStorage location\nOne machine\nMany machines\n\n\nScalability\nVertical (add more power)\nHorizontal (add more nodes)\n\n\nTypical capacity\nHigh but limited by hardware\nExtremely high, virtually unlimited\n\n\nCost\nExpensive to scale\nMore cost-efficient\n\n\n\n\n\nOLAP Systems (Online Analytical Processing)\n\nOLAP systems are optimized for READ-heavy analytical workloads. They store large volumes of historical data and support complex queries, aggregations, and trend analysis.\nKey Features:\n\nDesigned primarily for reading and analyzing data.\nNot optimized for frequent inserts/updates/deletes.\nStores historical and summarized information.\nSupports advanced analytics: dashboards, reports, trends, forecasting.\nTypically powered by data warehouses or data marts.\n\nExample: An e-commerce analyst retrieves last year’s order data from a data warehouse and analyzes trends across months, categories, or customer segments.\nCommon Technologies: Amazon Redshift, Snowflake,BigQuery, Apache Hive, Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services.\n\n\n\n\nOLTP Systems (Online Transaction Processing)\n\nOLTP systems are optimized for fast inserts, updates, and deletes. They handle high-volume transactional operations in real time.\nKey Features:\n\nProcesses large numbers of small, atomic transactions.\nEnsures consistency using ACID properties.\nOptimized for real-time operations.\nUsed by operational systems rather than analytics.\n\nExample: A bank’s ATM network continuously inserts, updates, or deletes records as customers make withdrawals, deposits, or transfers.\nCommon Technologies: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB (as transactional store).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantAbout ACID, BASE and CAP Theorem\n\n\n\nIn computer science, ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability)** is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction.\n\nThe opposite of ACID is BASE (basically available, soft state, and eventually consistent).\nIn ACID the whole transaction fails if an error occurs in any step within the transaction; in contrast, BASE databases prioritize availability over consistency: instead of failing the transaction, users can access inconsistent data temporarily: data consistency is achieved, but not immediately.\nIn distributed systems, trade-offs described by the CAP theorem mean that databases often lean toward ACID or BASE characteristics, depending on design and workload.\nModern systems may implement hybrid approaches, but trade-offs always exist. But it cannot be both according to CAP theorem.\nFor example, SQL databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, AWS RedShift) are structured over the ACID model, while NoSQL databases (like DynamoDB[4] or MongoDB) use the BASE architecture. However, some NoSQL databases might exhibit certain ACID traits\n\n\n\n\n\nOLAP vs OLTP: Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nOLAP\nOLTP\n\n\n\n\nPrimary purpose\nAnalytics, reporting\nReal-time transactions\n\n\nQuery type\nRead-heavy, complex\nWrite-heavy, simple\n\n\nData volume\nHistorical, large datasets\nCurrent transactional data\n\n\nPerformance optimized for\nAggregations, scans\nFast inserts/updates/deletes\n\n\nCommon use cases\nDashboards, BI, trend analysis\nBanking, retail transactions, booking systems\n\n\nUsers\nAnalysts, data scientists\nEnd-users, applications, machines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteReading\n\n\n\nOLTPvsOLAP",

    "text": "Data Management Architectures\nOkay, we got high level understanding about the databases and their types, however in real life applications we need to master the so called Data Management Architecture (DMA). Let’s go over them chronologically:\n\nData Warehouse (DW)\nData Mart (DM)\nData Lake (DL)\nData Lakehouse (DLH)\n\n\nData Warehouse (DW)\nThe earliest large-scale analytics storage (1980-90s).\nA Data Warehouse is a centralized, structured, and governed analytical storage designed for reporting, business intelligence, and decision-making. Everything inside is modeled, cleaned, validated, and optimized for SQL analytics.\n\n\nPurpose\n\nProvide a single version of truth for the organization.\nServe business reporting, dashboards, KPIs.\nAllow analysts to run consistent, repeatable metrics.\n\n\n\nArchitecture\n\nCore storage: relational tables in Star or Snowflake schema.\nETL/ELT pipelines transform raw data into structured models.\nStrong governance: data quality rules, validation layers, semantic models.\n\n\n\nSchema Approach\n\nSchema-on-write: data must be modeled before it enters.\nFacts (large numerical tables).\nDimensions (lookup tables with business attributes).\nConformed dimensions for uniform interpretation (e.g., Customer, Product).\n\n\n\nQuery Model\n\nAggregations, joins, slicing/dicing, reporting.\nOptimized for read-heavy workloads.\n\n\n\nAdvantages\n\nHigh data quality\nStrong governance\nFast SQL analytics\nBusiness-friendly, predictable models\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\nRigid: changes require redesign\nPoor for raw, unstructured data\nExpensive for large-scale storage\nNot ideal for ML pipelines that need raw historical data\n\n\n\nTypical Tools/Platforms\n\nSnowflake (warehouse mode)\nAmazon Redshift\nGoogle BigQuery (classic DW usage)\nTeradata\nOracle Exadata\n\n\n\nRelationship to others\n\nDW is the parent of DM.\nDW predates DL and DLH.\n\n\n\n\nData Mart (DM)\nIntroduced after Data Warehouses (late 1990s).\nA Data Mart is a subject-specific, department-focused subset of a Data Warehouse. It is optimized for a particular business domain such as Marketing, Finance, Sales, HR, or Operations.\n\n\nPurpose\n\nReduce load on the central Data Warehouse.\nDeliver faster, domain-specific analytics.\nAllow departments to have tailored KPIs and models.\nImprove performance by minimizing unnecessary joins and tables.\n\n\n\nArchitecture\n\nUsually built as dependent data marts, sourced from the DW.\nSometimes built as independent data marts (less common today).\nDomain-specific schemas (e.g., Marketing Mart, Finance Mart).\nCan use star/snowflake schemas but simplified for a business unit.\n\n\n\nSchema Approach\n\nSchema-on-write (same as DW).\nContains facts/dimensions relevant only to one business domain.\nMay extend or customize dimensions (e.g., Marketing_Customer).\n\n\n\nQuery Model\n\nFaster analytical queries for a single domain.\nReduced table complexity.\nSupports dashboards, KPI reporting, and departmental insights.\n\n\n\nAdvantages\n\nHigh performance for domain-specific workloads\nReduces contention on the central DW\nSimpler models for end users\nEnables data ownership by individual departments\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\nCan create data silos if unmanaged\nRequires synchronization with DW\nPotential duplication of logic if marts diverge\n\n\nData Silo\n\n\n\nTypical Tools/Platforms\n\nSnowflake Data Marts\nRedshift Data Marts\nBigQuery departmental datasets\nMicrosoft SQL Server departmental warehouses\n\n\n\nRelationship to others\n\nDM is the child of DW.\nRelies on DW for consistency.\nNot directly related to Data Lakes or Lakehouses except in hybrid architectures.\n\n\n\n\n\nData Lake (DL)\nIntroduced during the Big Data era (2010s).\nA Data Lake is a large-scale, low-cost, raw-data storage system that can ingest structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data without modeling.\n\n\nPurpose\n\nStore massive amounts of raw data cheaply.\nSupport machine learning and exploratory analytics.\nCapture logs, JSON files, clickstreams, IoT data, images, audio.\nPreserve granular, historical data with no loss.\n\n\n\nArchitecture\n\nBuilt on object storage (S3, GCS, ADLS, or HDFS).\nOrganized into zones: raw, curated, prepared.\nIngestion via ELT pipelines.\nOften uses frameworks like Spark, Hive, Presto, or Dremio.\n\n\n\nSchema Approach\n\nSchema-on-read: structure is applied only at query time.\nSupports open formats: Parquet, ORC, Avro, CSV, JSON.\nCan handle unstructured formats (text, logs, images).\n\n\n\nQuery Model\n\nFlexible but slower than DW for SQL analytics.\nBest for ML workloads requiring raw historical data.\nHandles batch and streaming ingestion.\n\n\n\nAdvantages\n\nExtremely flexible storage model\nVery low cost for large-scale data\nExcellent for ML, experimentation, and data science\nDecouples storage from compute\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\nNo ACID guarantees in traditional lakes\nPoor governance (risk of “data swamp”)\nHard for business teams to use directly\nNot optimized for BI dashboards\n\n\n\nTypical Tools/Platforms\n\nAWS S3 + Athena / EMR\nAzure Data Lake Storage\nGoogle Cloud Storage + BigQuery external tables\nHadoop HDFS\nDatabricks in lake mode\n\n\n\nRelationship to others\n\nDL evolved after DW and DM.\nPredecessor of the DLH.\nDW and DL often coexist in two-tier architectures.\n\n\n\n\nData Lakehouse (DLH)\nThe most modern architecture (2020s).\nA Data Lakehouse is a unified, ACID-compliant, analytics + ML architecture built on top of Data Lake storage.\nIt merges the strengths of Data Warehouses and Data Lakes into a single system.\n\n\nPurpose\n\nProvide a single platform for SQL analytics, BI, ML, and streaming.\nAvoid duplication between DW and DL.\nGuarantee ACID transactions and strong governance on cheap lake storage.\nSupport both structured and unstructured data.\n\n\n\nArchitecture\n\nStorage on cloud object stores (S3, ADLS, GCS).\nACID table formats: Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi.\nMetadata layers for schema enforcement, governance, versioning.\nCompute engines: Spark, Databricks, Presto/Trino, Snowflake, BigQuery.\n\n\n\nSchema Approach\n\nSupports both schema-on-write and schema-on-read.\nAllows schema evolution, time travel, and versioning.\nEnforces constraints even on raw lake storage.\n\n\n\nQuery Model\n\nHigh-performance SQL (warehouse-like).\nML workloads (lake-like).\nSupports batch, streaming, and real-time analytics.\nWorks for both BI dashboards and ML pipelines.\n\n\n\nAdvantages\n\nUnifies DW + DL into one architecture\nACID guarantees on object storage\nSuitable for both BI and ML\nSimplifies pipelines and governance\nScalable and cost-effective\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\nRequires organizational adoption and re-skilling\nGovernance maturity varies by platform\nClassic DW teams may struggle to transition\n\n\n\nTypical Tools/Platforms\n\nDatabricks Lakehouse (Delta)\nSnowflake (Unistore + Iceberg)\nBigQuery (Lakehouse-friendly design)\nApache Iceberg + Trino/Presto\nApache Hudi platforms\n\n\n\nRelationship to others\n\nDLH is the evolution of the Data Lake.\nDLH aims to unify and simplify analytics workloads.\nDLH may replace DW in modern architectures.",

They help you understand how strongly variables are related (not necessarily causally), and the appropriate measure depends on the type of data (continuous, ordinal, categorical, binary, etc.)\nIn the scope of bootcamp we are going to concetrate on two measures:\n\nCovariance\nCorrelation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDuring the Python module we are going to cover Chi-Squered test as well\n\n\n\nCovariance\n\nCovariance describes the direction of the linear relationship between two variables.\n\nA positive covariance means the variables tend to increase together.\n\nA negative covariance means one variable increases as the other decreases.\n\nThe magnitude of covariance does not indicate the strength of association.\n\nTherefore, covariance is useful for describing direction, but not strength.\n\n\\[\ns_{xy} =\n\\frac{\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})\n}{\nn -1\n}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(x_i\\), \\(y_i\\) are paired observations\n\n\\(\\bar{x}\\) = mean of the \\(x\\) values\n\n\\(\\bar{y}\\) = mean of the \\(y\\) values\n\n\\(n\\) = sample size\n\nCovariance uses the product of deviations to identify whether\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) move in the same direction (positive) or opposite directions (negative).\n\n\nCorrelation\nCorrelation standardizes covariance so that it always falls between –1.0 and +1.0.

intervals:\n\nper hour\n\nper day\n\nper kilometer\n\nper page view session\n\nA random variable \\(X\\) follows a Poisson distribution if:\n\\[\nX \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)\n\\]\nwhere:\n\\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\) is the average number of events per interval\nThe parameter \\(\\lambda\\) captures the typical intensity of events.\nIt answers:\n\n“On average, how many events should I expect in this interval?”\n\nImportantly:\n\nEvents are independent\nThe average rate is stable\nEvents occur randomly, not in bursts or schedules\n\n\nReal-World Narrative\nImagine a retail store observing customer foot traffic.\nEvery 10 minutes, a random number of customers enter the store.\nOver many days, management notices:\n\nSome intervals have 1–2 customers\n\nSome have 5–6 customers\n\nOccasionally, none\n\nYet the average stays roughly the same.\nTypical Poisson use cases in retail and digital analytics:\n\nnumber of customers entering per hour\n\nnumber of purchases per minute in an online shop\n\nnumber of returns processed in each 30-minute window\n\nnumber of carts abandoned per hour\n\nIf these events:\n\nhappen independently\noccur at a stable average rate\n\n…then the count of events per interval follows a Poisson distribution.\n\n\nProbability Mass Function\nThe PMF of a Poisson random variable is:\n\\[\nP(X = x) = \\frac{\\lambda^x e^{-\\lambda}}{x!}, \\quad x = 0,1,2,\\dots\n\\]\n\n\\(x\\) is an exact count\n\nThis formula gives the probability of seeing exactly \\(x\\) events\n\n\n\nExpected Value and Variance\nFor a Poisson distribution both Variance and Expected Value\n\\[\nE[X] = \\lambda\n\\]\n\\[\nVar(X) = \\lambda\n\\]\n\nThe average number of events equals \\(\\lambda\\)\n\nThe uncertainty (variance) grows at the same rate\n\nThis makes Poisson models easy to interpret and diagnose.\n\n\nBusiness Interpretation of \\(\\lambda\\)\n\nLarge \\(\\lambda\\) → frequent events\n\nSmall \\(\\lambda\\) → rare events\n\nConcrete examples:\n\n\\(\\lambda = 2\\) → about 2 calls per hour\n\n\\(\\lambda = 15\\) → about 15 website visits per minute\n\n\\(\\lambda = 0.2\\) → a rare failure, once every 5 intervals\n\n\n\nBusiness Applications of Poisson Distribution\nPoisson models are widely used in practice for:\n\ncustomer arrivals and foot traffic\n\ncall center volume estimation\n\nwebsite click and impression counts\n\nmanufacturing defects\n\nincident and outage reporting\n\nThese models help translate random counts into actionable forecasts.\n\n\nSpreadsheet Demonstration\nAssume \\(\\lambda\\) is stored in cell B1.\n\nPMF for \\(x\\): =POISSON.DIST(x, B1, FALSE)\nCDF (at most \\(x\\) events): =POISSON.DIST(x, B1, TRUE)\n\nTypical spreadsheet questions:\n\n“What is the probability of more than 10 calls this hour?”\n\n“What is the chance we see zero purchases in 5 minutes?”\n\nThese are answered directly using the Poisson CDF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nReference for POISSON.DIST in Distributions Spreadsheets:\n\n\n\n\nRelationship to Continuous Models\n\nExponential distribution models time between events\nPoisson distribution models number of events\n\nThey describe the same process from different perspectives.\n\n\nVisualization\n\nLeft plot → PMF for \\(\\lambda = 3\\) and \\(\\lambda = 10\\)\n\nRight plot → likelihood as a function of \\(\\lambda\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nHigher \\(\\lambda\\) means more customers entering per time interval.\n\nLower \\(\\lambda\\) means slower foot traffic.\n\nIn our observed retail data:\n\nTotal customers: \\(S = 23\\)\n\nNumber of intervals: \\(n = 6\\)\nMLE: \\(\\hat{\\lambda} = 23/6 = 3.83\\) customers per interval\n\nMeaning\n\non average, about 3.8 customers arrive every 10 minutes,\n\nwhich translates to roughly 23 customers per hour.\n\nThis insight directly supports:\n\nstaff scheduling\n\ncheckout lane allocation\n\npeak-hour planning\n\ndemand forecasting\n\ncapacity optimization\n\nPoisson models turn randomness into operational clarity.\n\n\nCase Study\nIn practice, “fitting a Poisson model” means:\n\nconfirming the data matches the Poisson story\n\nestimating \\(\\lambda\\)\n\nchecking whether the fitted model matches the observed counts\n\n\nBusiness Context\nA retail store records the number of customers entering the store every 10 minutes during a weekday afternoon (14:00–16:00).\n\nTime window length is fixed\n\nEvents are counts\n\nGoal: model arrivals and estimate

10-minute interval}\n\\]\nKey properties:\n\n\\(X\\) is a count\n\\(X \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots\\}\\)\nInterval length is fixed\n\nThis definition already aligns with the Poisson framework.\nBefore computing anything, we check the story, not formulas.\n\nFixed interval length → yes (10 minutes)\nCounting events → yes (customers)\nIndependence → reasonable in short windows\nStable average rate → plausible for this time range\n\nThis tells us:\n\nA Poisson model is a reasonable first approximation.",

    "text": "Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\nThe normal distribution is kind of magical in that we see it a lot in nature. But there’s a reason for that, and that reason makes it super useful for statistics as well. The Central Limit Theorem is the basis for a lot of statistics and the good news is that it is a pretty simple concept. That magic is called The Central Limit Theorem (CLT).\n\n\n“Even if you’re not normal, the average is normal”\n\n\nBig Idea\nThe Central Limit Theorem states that when we take many independent samples from a population and compute the average of each sample, the distribution of those averages:\n\napproaches a Normal distribution\nas the sample size increases\nregardless of the shape of the original distribution\n(provided the variance is finite)\n\nIn symbols, if:\n\\[\nX_1, X_2, ..., X_n\n\\] are independent with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), then the sample mean: \\[\n\\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\n\\] has an approximate Normal distribution for large \\(n\\): \\[\n\\bar{X} \\approx \\mathcal{N}\\!\\left(\\mu,\\,\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters\nIn analytics, we rarely care about one single observation;\nInstead we often care about:\n\nsample means\n\ntotals\n\nproportions\n\ndifferences of means\n\nEven if the raw data come from a non-Normal distribution, the CLT tells us the distribution of these statistics will be approximately Normal when the sample size is sufficiently large.\nThis underpins many common tools, including:\n\nconfidence intervals\n\nhypothesis tests\n\nregressions\n\nA/B testing\n\ncontrol charts\n\n\n\nIntuition with an Example\nImagine you repeatedly sample from a skewed distribution — say, an exponential distribution (like waiting times).\nEven though individual values are skewed, the distribution of average values will look more symmetric and bell-shaped when you increase the sample size.\nThis “averaging effect” is why Normal distributions are so prevalent in real data.\n\n\n\nSimulation of CLT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the Simulation Shows\n\nFor small sample sizes, the distribution of sample means is skewed.\nAs sample size increases:\n\nthe distribution becomes more symmetric\nit takes on the bell-shaped form\nit becomes closer to Normal\n\n\nThis happens even though the original population was not Normal.\n\n\n\nConditions for the CLT to Work\nThe CLT applies when:\n\nsamples are independent\nthe sample size is large enough\nthe population has finite variance\n\nIn practice, a sample size of 30 or more is often enough for many distributions.\n\n\n\nPractical Importance\nThe CLT justifies:\n\nusing Normal distribution tools for inference\napproximating distributions of sums/means\nconstructing confidence intervals\nperforming hypothesis tests\n\nEven for non-Normal raw data, aggregating information leads to Normal behavior.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem explains the widespread appearance of Normal distributions.\nIt applies to sample means (and sums) of independent observations.\nIt works even when individual data are not Normal.\nIt is a cornerstone of statistical inference.\n\n\n“Even if you’re not normal, the average is normal.”",

    "text": "In the statistical world, a hypothesis is an assumption about a specific population parameter, such as a mean, a proportion, or a standard deviation.\nWe Data Analyists/Statisticians like to make an assumptions about the value of a population parameter, and then:\n\ncollect a sample from that population,\nmeasure the sample,\ndeclare in ascholarly manner, whether the sample supports the original assumption.\n\nThis, in a nutshell, is what hypothesis testing is all about.\n\n\n\nA recent Wall Street Journal article titled “Does the Internet Make You Smarter or Dumber?” posed the possibility that online activities turn us into shallow thinkers. The article cited a statistic claiming that the average time an American spends looking at a Web page is 56 seconds. A researcher at a local university would like to test this claim using a hypothesis test.\n\n\nThe null hypothesis denoted by \\(H_0\\), represents the status quo and involves stating the belief that the population parameter is \\(\\le,=, \\ge\\) a specific value. The null hypothesis is believed to be true unless there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\n\n\n\nThe alternative hypothesis, denoted by \\(H_1\\), represents the opposite of the null hypothesis and is believed to be true if the null hypothesis is found to be false. The alternative hypothesis always states that the population parameter is \\(\\gt,\\ne, \\lt\\) a specific value.\nYou need to be careful how you state the null and alternative hypotheses. Your decision will depend on the nature of the test and the motivation of the person conducting it. Suppose the purpose of the test is to determine if the population mean is equal to a specific value, which is what we would want to test based on our previous Wall Street Journal article\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantAnalogy with the Legal System\n\n\n\nWe can never accept the Null Hypothesis!\nIn order to completely understand the process consider the analogy with the legal system.\nWe can either reject it or not reject it (fail to reject it)\nThe court system assumes a persion is innocent until proben guily, the hypothesis test is formulated as follows\n\n\\(H_0:\\) the defendant is innocent (status quo)\n\\(H_1:\\) the defendant is guilty\n\nThe court system might have two conclusions:\n\nReject the Null Hypothesis \\(\\rightarrow\\) the defendant is guilty\nFail to reject the Null Hypothesis \\(\\rightarrow\\) the defendant is guilty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the null and alternative hypotheses\nSet a value for the significance level \\(\\alpha\\)\nDetermine the appropriate critical value\nCalculate the appropriate test statistic\nCompare the test statistics with the critical score\nState your conclusion\n\n\n\nYou need to be careful how you state the null and alternative hypotheses. Your decision will depend on the nature of the test and the motivation of the person conducting it. Suppose the purpose of the test is to determine if the population mean is equal to a specific value, which is what we would want to test based on our previous Wall Street Journal article. We would then assign this statement as the null hypothesis, which results in the following equation:\nIn this example the Internet users spend an average timeof 56 seconds on a Web page. Thus the status quo would be:\n\\[\nH_0: \\mu = 56 \\text{ seconds (status quo)}\n\\]\n\\[\nH_1: \\mu \\ne  56 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Tailed Test\nLeft-Tailed Test\nRight-Tailed Test\n\n\n\n\nNull\n\\[H_0: \\mu = 56\\]\n\\[H_0: \\mu \\ge 56\\]\n\\[H_0: \\mu \\le 56\\]\n\n\nAlternative\n\\[H_1: \\mu \\ne 56\\]\n\\[H_1: \\mu &lt; 56\\]\n\\[H_1: \\mu &gt; 56\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe level of significance represents the probability of making a Type I error. A Type I error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis but it is actually true. In the scope of the program we will set \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) which is a common value used in hypothesis testing.\n\nIn the scope the above example Type I Error we conclude that the true average time spent on a webpage is not 56 seconds, even though in reality it is 56 seconds.\n\n\n\n\nAlpha (α)\nTail\nCritical z-Score\nCritical t-Score (df = 20)\n\n\n\n\n0.01\nOne\n2.33\n2.528\n\n\n0.01\nTwo\n2.575\n2.845\n\n\n0.02\nOne\n2.05\n2.312\n\n\n0.02\nTwo\n2.33\n2.528\n\n\n0.05\nOne\n1.645\n1.725\n\n\n0.05\nTwo\n1.96\n2.086\n\n\n0.10\nOne\n1.28\n1.325\n\n\n0.10\nTwo\n1.645\n1.725\n\n\n\nIn practical terms:\n\nThe researcher conducts a sample study.\nThe sample mean differs enough from 56 seconds to fall outside the acceptance region.\nThe test rejects the null hypothesis at the 5%level.\nBut in truth, Americans do spend exactly 56 seconds on average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIn case of z-test\n\n\n\nWhen Variance is known\n\ntest statistic would be \\(z_{\\bar{x}}\\)\n\ncritical value would be \\(z_{\\alpha}\\)\n\n\\[\nz_{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_{H_0}}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\nGiven\n\nClaimed mean: \\(\\mu_{H_0} = 56\\) seconds\n\nSample mean: \\(\\bar{x} = 62\\) seconds\n\nPopulation standard deviation (historical estimate): \\(\\sigma = 18\\) seconds\n\nSample size: \\(n = 45\\)\n\n\\[\nz_{\\bar{x}}\n= \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_{H_0}}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}}\n= \\frac{62 - 56}{18 / \\sqrt{45}}\n= \\frac{6}{2.683}\n= 2.24\n\\]\nA test statistic of 2.24 lies well into the rejection region (far from 0).\n\nFor a two-tailed test at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), the critical values are \\(\\pm 1.96\\).\n\nSince 2.24 &gt; 1.96, we reject \\(H_0\\).\n\nInterpretation:\nThere is statistically significant evidence that the true average time spent on a webpage is different from 56 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIn case of t-test\n\n\n\nWhen Variance is Unknown\n\ntest statistic would be \\(t_{\\bar{x}}\\)\n\ncritical value would be \\(t_{\\alpha}\\) (from the t-table)\n\n\\[\nt_{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_{H_0}}{s / \\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\nGiven\n\nClaimed mean: \\(\\mu_{H_0} = 56\\) seconds\n\nSample mean: \\(\\bar{x} = 62\\) seconds\n\nSample standard deviation: \\(s = 20\\) seconds\n\nSample size: \\(n = 30\\)\n\nDegrees of freedom: \\(df = n - 1 = 29\\)\n\nTest Statistic\n\\[\nt_{\\bar{x}}\n= \\frac{62 - 56}{20 / \\sqrt{30}}\n= \\frac{6}{3.651}\n= 1.64\n\\]\nCritical Value\nFor a two-tailed test at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) with \\(df = 29\\):\n\\[f\nt_{\\alpha/2, \\, df} = t_{0.025,29} = 2.045\n\\]\nDecision\nSince 1.64 &lt; 2.045, we fail to reject \\(H_0\\).

    "text": "In the statistical world, a hypothesis is an assumption about a specific population parameter, such as a mean, a proportion, or a standard deviation.\nWe Data Analyists/Statisticians like to make an assumptions about the value of a population parameter, and then:\n\ncollect a sample from that population,\nmeasure the sample,\ndeclare in ascholarly manner, whether the sample supports the original assumption.\n\nThis, in a nutshell, is what hypothesis testing is all about.\n\n\n\nA recent Wall Street Journal article titled “Does the Internet Make You Smarter or Dumber?” posed the possibility that online activities turn us into shallow thinkers. The article cited a statistic claiming that the average time an American spends looking at a Web page is 56 seconds. A researcher at a local university would like to test this claim using a hypothesis test.\n\n\nThe null hypothesis denoted by \\(H_0\\), represents the status quo and involves stating the belief that the population parameter is \\(\\le,=, \\ge\\) a specific value. The null hypothesis is believed to be true unless there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\n\n\n\nThe alternative hypothesis, denoted by \\(H_1\\), represents the opposite of the null hypothesis and is believed to be true if the null hypothesis is found to be false. The alternative hypothesis always states that the population parameter is \\(\\gt,\\ne, \\lt\\) a specific value.\nYou need to be careful how you state the null and alternative hypotheses. Your decision will depend on the nature of the test and the motivation of the person conducting it. Suppose the purpose of the test is to determine if the population mean is equal to a specific value, which is what we would want to test based on our previous Wall Street Journal article\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantAnalogy with the Legal System\n\n\n\nWe can never accept the Null Hypothesis!\nIn order to completely understand the process consider the analogy with the legal system.\nWe can either reject it or not reject it (fail to reject it)\nThe court system assumes a persion is innocent until proben guily, the hypothesis test is formulated as follows\n\n\\(H_0:\\) the defendant is innocent (status quo)\n\\(H_1:\\) the defendant is guilty\n\nThe court system might have two conclusions:\n\nReject the Null Hypothesis \\(\\rightarrow\\) the defendant is guilty\nFail to reject the Null Hypothesis \\(\\rightarrow\\) the defendant is guilty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the null and alternative hypotheses\nSet a value for the significance level \\(\\alpha\\)\nDetermine the appropriate critical value\nCalculate the appropriate test statistic\nCompare the test statistics with the critical score\nState your conclusion\n\n\n\nYou need to be careful how you state the null and alternative hypotheses. Your decision will depend on the nature of the test and the motivation of the person conducting it. Suppose the purpose of the test is to determine if the population mean is equal to a specific value, which is what we would want to test based on our previous Wall Street Journal article. We would then assign this statement as the null hypothesis, which results in the following equation:\nIn this example the Internet users spend an average timeof 56 seconds on a Web page. Thus the status quo would be:\n\\[\nH_0: \\mu = 56 \\text{ seconds (status quo)}\n\\]\n\\[\nH_1: \\mu \\ne  56 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Tailed Test\nLeft-Tailed Test\nRight-Tailed Test\n\n\n\n\nNull\n\\[H_0: \\mu = 56\\]\n\\[H_0: \\mu \\ge 56\\]\n\\[H_0: \\mu \\le 56\\]\n\n\nAlternative\n\\[H_1: \\mu \\ne 56\\]\n\\[H_1: \\mu &lt; 56\\]\n\\[H_1: \\mu &gt; 56\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe level of significance represents the probability of making a Type I error. A Type I error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis but it is actually true. In the scope of the program we will set \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) which is a common value used in hypothesis testing.\n\nIn the scope the above example Type I Error we conclude that the true average time spent on a webpage is not 56 seconds, even though in reality it is 56 seconds.\n\n\n\n\nAlpha (α)\nTail\nCritical z-Score\nCritical t-Score (df = 20)\n\n\n\n\n0.01\nOne\n2.33\n2.528\n\n\n0.01\nTwo\n2.575\n2.845\n\n\n0.02\nOne\n2.05\n2.312\n\n\n0.02\nTwo\n2.33\n2.528\n\n\n0.05\nOne\n1.645\n1.725\n\n\n0.05\nTwo\n1.96\n2.086\n\n\n0.10\nOne\n1.28\n1.325\n\n\n0.10\nTwo\n1.645\n1.725\n\n\n\nIn practical terms:\n\nThe researcher conducts a sample study.\nThe sample mean differs enough from 56 seconds to fall outside the acceptance region.\nThe test rejects the null hypothesis at the 5%level.\nBut in truth, Americans do spend exactly 56 seconds on average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIn case of z-test\n\n\n\nWhen Variance is known\n\ntest statistic would be \\(z_{\\bar{x}}\\)\n\ncritical value would be \\(z_{\\alpha}\\)\n\n\\[\nz_{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_{H_0}}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\nGiven\n\nClaimed mean: \\(\\mu_{H_0} = 56\\) seconds\n\nSample mean: \\(\\bar{x} = 62\\) seconds\n\nPopulation standard deviation (historical estimate): \\(\\sigma = 18\\) seconds\n\nSample size: \\(n = 45\\)\n\n\\[\nz_{\\bar{x}}\n= \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_{H_0}}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}}\n= \\frac{62 - 56}{18 / \\sqrt{45}}\n= \\frac{6}{2.683}\n= 2.24\n\\]\nA test statistic of 2.24 lies well into the rejection region (far from 0).\n\nFor a two-tailed test at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), the critical values are \\(\\pm 1.96\\).\n\nSince 2.24 &gt; 1.96, we reject \\(H_0\\).\n\nInterpretation:\nThere is statistically significant evidence that the true average time spent on a webpage is different from 56 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIn case of t-test\n\n\n\nWhen Variance is Unknown\n\ntest statistic would be \\(t_{\\bar{x}}\\)\n\ncritical value would be \\(t_{\\alpha}\\) (from the t-table)\n\n\\[\nt_{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_{H_0}}{s / \\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\nGiven\n\nClaimed mean: \\(\\mu_{H_0} = 56\\) seconds\n\nSample mean: \\(\\bar{x} = 62\\) seconds\n\nSample standard deviation: \\(s = 20\\) seconds\n\nSample size: \\(n = 30\\)\n\nDegrees of freedom: \\(df = n - 1 = 29\\)\n\nTest Statistic\n\\[\nt_{\\bar{x}}\n= \\frac{62 - 56}{20 / \\sqrt{30}}\n= \\frac{6}{3.651}\n= 1.64\n\\]\nCritical Value\nFor a two-tailed test at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) with \\(df = 29\\):\n\\[f\nt_{\\alpha/2, \\, df} = t_{0.025,29} = 2.045\n\\]\nDecision\nSince 1.64 &lt; 2.045, we fail to reject \\(H_0\\).

    "text": "What Is Data Analytics?\nData analytics is the practice of examining data systematically to discover useful information, reach conclusions, and support decision-making.\nIn practice, it bridges raw data and business strategy. The process typically follows five stages:\n\nData Generation – transactions, sensors, user interactions, or surveys produce raw data.\n\nCollection and Storage – data is gathered and kept in databases, data warehouses, or cloud systems.\n\nProcessing and Integration – data is cleaned, formatted, and connected across sources.\n\nAnalysis and Modeling – statistical or machine-learning methods reveal patterns and predict outcomes.\n\nCommunication and Action – visualizations, dashboards, and reports communicate insights for business decisions.\n\nThis “data-to-insight” flow is iterative; every analysis generates new questions that feed the next cycle.\n\nBusiness Applications of Data Analytics\nAnalytics supports decision-making across many domains:\n\nTelecommunications: predicting churn, optimizing network performance, or tailoring offers.\n\nRetail: analyzing baskets, forecasting demand, or optimizing pricing.\n\nFinance: assessing credit risk or detecting fraud.\n\nMarketing: evaluating campaign effectiveness and designing experiments (A/B tests).\n\nHealthcare: identifying risk factors or optimizing treatment outcomes.\n\nThe unifying theme is that analytics translates data into value by informing actions.\n\n\n\nTypes of Analytics\nDifferent analytical approaches answer different questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nCentral Question\nTypical Methods\nExample\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive\nWhat happened?\nAggregation, visualization\nMonthly sales by region\n\n\nDiagnostic\nWhy did it happen?\nCorrelation, segmentation\nAnalyzing the effect of pricing on sales\n\n\nPredictive\nWhat might happen?\nRegression, classification, forecasting\nPredicting churn probability\n\n\nPrescriptive\nWhat should we do?\nOptimization, simulation\nRecommending personalized offers\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation with Lego\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTry fit your story according the above image.\n\n\n\n\nThe Data Lifecycle and Professional Roles\nThe data lifecycle describes how information moves through an organization and is transformed into insight.\n\nCapture / Collection: raw data is obtained from transactional systems, sensors, APIs, or external datasets.\n\nStorage / Management: engineers design and maintain databases, warehouses, or data lakes to store data efficiently and securely.\n\nProcessing / Transformation: data is cleaned, structured, and enriched to prepare it for analysis.\n\nAnalysis / Modeling: analytical teams explore data, test hypotheses, and build models that explain or predict outcomes.\n\nCommunication / Decision: results are shared through dashboards, visualizations, and reports to support business actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole\nPrimary Responsibilities\n\n\n\n\nData Engineer\nBuilds and maintains the data infrastructure, pipelines, and integrations that collect and store raw data.\n\n\nAnalytics Engineer\nBridges engineering and analysis by transforming raw data into clean, documented, and reusable datasets—often using SQL, dbt, and data-modeling best practices.

    "text": "The Data Layers\n\nDefinition of data\nData is used in its broadest sense: observations, measurements and facts (both quantitative and qualitative) that serve as information or evidence.\n\n\nZero-party data\nData intentionally or proactively shared by audiences, such as:\n\nResponses to polls, surveys or quizzes\nProfiling details added to online accounts or loyalty programmes\n\n\n\nFirst-party data\nProprietary data collected directly (with consent) via a company’s own channels. It typically captures behaviours and is a key marketing asset.\nCommon sources include:\n\nDigital interactions (website, apps)\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) systems\nContent engagement\nPoint-of-sale systems\nTransactions (accounting systems)\nInteractions with digital support and call centres\n\nExamples of first-party data products:\n\nSales performance metrics by region/country/category\nCRM extracts: contact info, purchase and interaction history for segmentation/personalization\nLoyalty/payment card purchase data showing behavioural patterns\nEmail marketing metrics: open rate, click-through rate, subscriber behaviour\n\n\n\nSecond-party data\nData not collected by the business itself but associated with its customers/audiences and obtained via a partnership or contractual agreement.\nExamples:\n\nRetail purchase data\nMarket research and survey data\nChannel partner/supplier data treated as first-party within that relationship\n\nTypical second-party sources in business:\n\nIn-store shopper research\nPanels/retail share data (e.g., Kantar/Nielsen/IRI/Mintel)\nBrand and communications tracking studies; ad testing; in-depth interviews\nWeb scraping (owned sites) and forums for sentiment, reviews, and competitive intelligence\n\n\n\nThird-party data\nData collected by another entity that doesn’t have a direct link to your customers/audiences, often aggregated and licensed for use. (Note: privacy regulations like GDPR have tightened access and usage.)\nTrusted third-party examples:\n\nSocial platforms’ aggregated audience and behaviour insights\nExternal website analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) offering traffic, conversion, and interaction insights\nVendors (e.g., Experian/Acxiom/Dun & Bradstreet) providing profiles, segmentation, and targeting datasets\nOpen/public data (e.g., census aggregates)\n\n\nIn practice, most analytical teams draw from managed datasets in databases, platforms, or portals. These are often cleaned, contain business logic, and may blend multiple sources (e.g., CRM + ad-platform performance + third-party segments).",

In business settings, it is a form of communication that adapts structures from wider storytelling to persuade audiences to think, feel and act.\nData storytelling applies storytelling techniques to communicate insights, actions and ideas that come from data (rather than the raw data alone). It starts by understanding the data available within the broader goals, then draws out meaning from the background noise to guide the right conversations and decisions.\n\n\nData Reporting vs Data Story\nReporting focuses on standardized, repeatable outputs that explain the data point itself.\nStorytelling focuses on synthesizing evidence, reducing noise, and surfacing meaning and judgement to drive decisions and action. Visualization helps, but visualization alone is not a story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDimension\nData reporting\nData storytelling\n\n\n\n\nPrimary focus\nCommunicates the data\nCommunicates the insight and recommendations\n\n\nApproach\nStandardized\nCustomized to the situation and audience\n\n\nAudience effort\nRequires a data-literate audience\nDoes the hard work for the audience\n\n\nCore skills\nGood data visualization skills\nStrong critical thinking and creative communication\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle Source of Truth (SSOT)\nA Single Source of Truth (SSOT) is a practice in data management where one authoritative, trusted data source is designated for each data domain or metric.\nAll reports, dashboards, analyses, and decisions must rely on this source, ensuring consistency across the organization.\nIn simple terms:\none question \\(\\rightarrow\\) one correct answer, regardless of who asks it or where it is asked.\nWithout SSOT, organizations face inconsistent numbers, duplicated logic, and loss of trust in data. With SSOT, data becomes a strategic asset, not a source of conflict.\nKey benefits include:\n\nConsistency – The same metric (e.g., revenue, churn, active users) has the same value everywhere.\nTrust – Stakeholders trust data when numbers do not change between reports.\nEfficiency – Analysts and engineers stop re-implementing the same logic repeatedly.\nFaster decision-making – Less time spent reconciling discrepancies.\nGovernance & compliance – Clear ownership and traceability of data definitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe are going to re-address this topics during the Capstone Project.",

    "section": "Types of Bias in Data",
    "text": "Types of Bias in Data\nUnderstanding bias is crucial in data analytics, as it affects the reliability and fairness of insights and models.\nBelow are the main types of bias with examples and ways to avoid them.\nAs junior data analyist it’s easy to fall into the trap of believing that the data is objective, that it’s the raw truth, and that it can’t be spun or misinterpreted. If you were to believe these things, however, you’d be wrong.\nData is produced either by humans or by machines and algorithms that have been created by humans.\nIn other words, data lends itself to human bias, which can lead to poor decision-making or the adoption of false beliefs. Fortunately, there’s a solution to this problem, and while it may not eliminate 100% of the analytical pitfalls of bias, it can help you see the truth you seek whenever you initiate a data analytics project.\nThis solution is data ethics, and one of its guiding principles is transparency around the way data is sampled, tested, and processed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotedefinition\n\n\n\nBias can enter the data lifecycle at multiple stages.\nTo reason about it systematically, biases are grouped by where they originate and how they propagate downstream.\n\n\n\nData Coverage & Inclusion Biases\nBiases at this stage affect representation.\nIf present, all downstream analysis is structurally compromised.\nSellection Bias:\n\nSampling Bias\nExclusion Bias\nSurvivorship Bias\n\n\nSelection Bias\nHappens when certain groups are systematically excluded or included due to how data is selected.\nExample:\nA marketing campaign’s success is evaluated only on customers who opened emails, ignoring those who didn’t \\(\\rightarrow\\) engagement appears artificially high.\nHow to avoid:\n\nRandomize inclusion criteria; avoid convenience filtering (e.g., “openers only”).\n\nCompare included vs. excluded groups; use propensity scores or re-weighting.\n\nExpand recruitment channels and reduce barriers to inclusion.\n\n\n\nreading\n\n\nSampling Bias\nOccurs when the data collected is not representative of the entire population.\nExample:\nA telecom company predicts churn using data only from urban customers, ignoring rural ones. The model will likely perform poorly for rural areas.\nHow to avoid:\n\nDefine the target population explicitly and sample across all key segments (e.g., urban/rural, device types).\n\nUse probability sampling where possible; if not, weight to population benchmarks.\n\nMonitor sample composition continuously and correct drift.\n\n\n\nreading\n\n\n\nSurvivorship Bias\nFocusing only on successful cases while ignoring failures.\nExample:\nAnalyzing only successful marketing campaigns inflates perceived effectiveness.\nHow to avoid:\n\nTrack full cohorts, including churned/inactive or failed tests.\n\nReport denominator/attrition; analyze exits explicitly.\n\nAvoid filtering by “survived” outcomes in exploratory steps.\n\n\n\n\nreading\n\n\n\nExclusion Bias\nImportant variables are mistakenly left out during data collection or preprocessing.\nExample:\nAn e-commerce model excludes device_type (mobile vs. desktop), missing behavior differences that affect conversion.\nHow to avoid:\n\nMap requirements with domain experts; maintain a \"must-have\" variable inventory.\n\nTrace feature lineage; run ablation tests to detect missing signal.\n\nIterate collection forms/ETL to capture omitted fields.\n\n\n\nreading\n\n\n\n\n\nData Collection & Measurement Biases\nBiases at this stage affect how data is recorded and reported.\nEven with correct population coverage, poor measurement distorts reality.\nMeasurement Biases:\n\nMeasurement Bias\n\nRecall Bias\n\nResponse Bias\n\nObserver Bias\n\n\n\nMeasurement Bias\nArises from inaccurate tools or methods used to collect data.\nExample:\nA survey app records 0 when users skip a question instead of missing, misleading analysts to think respondents selected zero.\nHow to avoid:\n\nStandardize definitions and validation rules; treat missing explicitly.\n\nCalibrate and test instruments; run overlap/parallel periods when switching tools.\n\nInclude data-quality checks (range, type, logic) in ETL.\n\n\nreading\n\n\nRecall Bias\nOccurs when participants don’t accurately remember past events.\nExample:\nWhen asked how many times they visited a store last month, respondents under/over-report due to memory errors.\nHow to avoid:\n\nShorten recall windows; use diaries or passive behavioral data where possible.\n\nAsk concrete, bounded questions (“in the last 7 days”).\n\nProvide anchors/examples to improve recall.\n\n\nreading\n\n\n\n\nResponse Bias\nParticipants give socially desirable or expected answers rather than truthful ones.\nExample:\nIn a satisfaction survey, customers rate service higher to appear polite.\nHow to avoid:\n\nUse neutral wording and anonymity; avoid leading questions.\n\nPrefer behavioral measures over attitudinal when possible.\n\nInclude validity checks (e.g., reverse-coded items).\n\n\nreading\n\n\n\n\nObserver Bias\nA researcher’s expectations influence data collection or interpretation.\nExample:\nAn analyst expecting a new ad to perform better focuses on positive feedback and downplays negatives.\nHow to avoid:\n\nBlind analysts to treatment where feasible; pre-register analysis plans.\n\nUse objective scoring rubrics and inter-rater reliability checks.\n\nAutomate extraction or labeling where appropriate.\n\n\nreading\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis & Modeling Biases\nBiases at this stage affect interpretation, reasoning, and model learning.\nThey often amplify earlier data issues.\nAnalysis Biases:\n\nConfirmation Bias\n\nAvailability Bias\n\nHistorical Bias\n\nAlgorithmic Bias\n\n\n\nConfirmation Bias\nTendency to favor data that confirms existing beliefs or hypotheses.\nExample:\nA data scientist believes discounts improve retention and analyzes only high-discount months.\nHow to avoid:\n\nWrite the research question and success criteria before analysis.\n\nDeliberately seek disconfirming evidence;

    "section": "Types of Sampling",
    "text": "Types of Sampling\nThere are many options available for gathering samples from a population. The two basic types that we will discuss are:\n\nprobability sampling\nnonprobability sampling\n\n\nProbability Sampling\nA probability sample is a sample in which each member of the population has a known, nonzero, chance of being selected for the sample.\nThere are five main types of probability sampling techniques statisticians use:\n\nsimple random\nsystematic\nstratified\ncluster\nresampling\n\n\nSimple Random Sampling\nA simple random sample is a sample in which every member of the population has an equal chance of being chosen.\n\n\n\nSystematic Sampling\nIn systematic sampling, every k-th member of the population is chosen for the sample. The value of k is determined by dividing the size of the population (N) by the size of the sample (n).\nBut how do you know whcih value of k to choose? The value of k is the systematic sampling constant:\n\\[k = \\frac{N}{n}\\]\nwhere:\n\nN: Size of the population\nn: Size of the sample\n\nUsing my academic integrity survey, with a population of 1,800 students and a sample of 10:\n\\[k = \\frac{N}{n} = \\frac{1,800}{10}=180\\]\nFrom a listing of the entire population, I would choose every 180th student to be included in the sample.\n\nSystematic sampling is often easier to implement than a simple random sample.\n\nProblem\nA problem can arise if the population contains a repeating pattern that aligns with the interval (k). This periodicity can produce a biased sample.\nExample: selecting data every 4th week in an 8-week term may always fall on midterms or finals, leading to inflated study-hour data.\nSolution\nThe first selected unit does not have to be the first entry.We can randomly choose a starting position and then pick every (k)-th observation after that.\n\n\nStratified Sampling\nStratified sampling is used when specific subgroups within a population differ in ways that are important to the analysis. If these subgroups are not represented proportionally in the sample, the results may become biased—even when random sampling procedures are used.\nConsider a cybersecurity compliance study within a large technology company. Previous internal audits show that senior engineers tend to follow security protocols far more consistently than junior engineers. If we rely on simple random or systematic sampling, it is possible—simply by chance—that 45% of the selected employees will be senior engineers, even though they represent only 15% of the workforce. Such a sample would lead us to overestimate overall compliance levels.\nStratified sampling prevents this type of distortion. The population is divided into meaningful groups (such as junior, mid-level, senior, and management), and each group is sampled in proportion to its actual size. This ensures that the final sample mirrors the true composition of the population and that no subgroup with unusually high or low compliance influences the results disproportionately.\nIn contexts such as academic integrity studies, organizational culture assessments, customer-segmentation research, or ACA-style analytics projects, stratified sampling provides a more balanced, representative, and trustworthy basis for drawing conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStratum (Role Level)\nPopulation Size\nPopulation %\nSample Size (n = 200)\nCalculation\n\n\n\n\nJunior Engineers\n1,200\n40%\n80\n\\(0.40 \\times 200\\)\n\n\nMid-Level Engineers\n900\n30%\n60\n\\(0.30 \\times 200\\)\n\n\nSenior Engineers\n450\n15%\n30\n\\(0.15 \\times 200\\)\n\n\nManagement\n450\n15%\n30\n\\(0.15 \\times 200\\)\n\n\nTotal\n3,000\n100%\n200\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCluster Sampling\nCluster sampling divides the population into mutually exclusive groups—called clusters— where each cluster is intended to be a small-scale representation of the entire population. Instead of sampling individuals directly, we randomly select entire clusters and then either survey every member of those clusters or take a simple random sample within them.\nClusters are often based on geography or natural groupings to simplify data collection. For example, in an academic integrity study, classrooms at specific times of day could serve as clusters. Once a set of classrooms is randomly selected, all students in those rooms (or a sample of them) can be surveyed.\nA common source of confusion is the difference between strata and clusters:\n\nStrata are groups whose members share a common characteristic (e.g., all freshmen). Strata are typically homogeneous within each group and are used to ensure proper representation in the sample.\nClusters, by contrast, are “mini-populations”—often heterogeneous mixtures of different types of individuals (e.g., a classroom containing freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors). The goal is convenience and efficiency, not homogeneity.\n\nCluster sampling is widely used in business settings, especially when test-marketing new products. Companies select cities or regions as clusters and gather feedback from customers within those areas. When designed carefully, cluster sampling provides a cost-effective way to collect a probability sample while maintaining representativeness.\n\n\n\nResampling (Bootstrap)\nResampling is a statistical approach in which multiple samples are repeatedly drawn from an observed dataset to better understand the variability of a statistic. One of the most widely used resampling techniques is the bootstrap method, introduced by Bradley Efron at Stanford University.\nBootstrapping offers a practical, assumption-light method for estimating the uncertainty around statistical measures.\nBootstrapping works by drawing many samples with replacement from the original dataset. For each resample, we compute a statistic of interest—such as a mean, median, proportion, or variance. By repeating this process thousands of times, we obtain a distribution of the statistic, which helps us understand how much it varies and where the true population value is likely to fall.\nBootstrapping is flexible and powerful. Unlike many traditional statistical methods, it does not require strong assumptions about the underlying population distribution. It can be applied to estimate population parameters, standard errors, and measures of uncertainty for a wide variety of statistics.\n\nWebsite Conversion Rates (Digital Marketing)\nA marketing team measures the conversion rate of a landing page based on 600 user sessions. They use bootstrapping to repeatedly resample these outcomes and estimate the distribution of the conversion rate. This helps them compare campaign performance confidently without relying on theoretical formulas.\n\n\nModel Performance Metrics (Machine Learning)\nA data science team evaluates a predictive model using a dataset of 10,000 labeled observations. They apply bootstrapping to estimate the variability of accuracy, recall, or AUC scores. This produces more reliable estimates of model performance under different resampling conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple Random vs Systematic vs Stratified vs Cluster\n\n\n\n\nNonprobability Sampling\nA nonprobability sample is a sample in which the probability of a population member being selected for the sample is not known.\nA common type of nonprobability sample is a convenience sample. This type of sampling is useful when you are simply trying to gather some general information about the population.\n\nConvenience sample: A convenience sample is used when members of the population are chosen to become part of the sample simply because they are easily accessible.\nInternet Poll: Most individuals who participate in Internet polls have very little statistical training. They are impressed when they see thousands of responses recorded in real time and tend to believe the results.",

    "text": "Sampling and Nonsampling Errors\nWhen we rely on a sample instead of measuring an entire population, some level of error is unavoidable. Population values—known as parameters—are typically unknown, so we use statistics from our sample to estimate them. Because a sample represents only part of the population, the statistic will almost never match the parameter exactly. This difference is called sampling error, and it reflects the natural variability that occurs in any sampling process.\n\\[\\text{Sampling Error}=\\bar{x}-\\mu\\]\nwhere\n\n\\(\\bar{x}:\\) sample mean\n\\(\\mu:\\) population mean\n\nSampling error is expected and tends to decrease when the sample size increases. However, data collection can also be affected by nonsampling errors, which arise from factors unrelated to the sampling procedure. These include biased survey questions, measurement mistakes, data entry errors, or low response rates. Unlike sampling errors, nonsampling errors cannot be reduced simply by collecting more data.\n\nRecognizing the difference between sampling and nonsampling errors is essential for evaluating how accurate and reliable a study’s conclusions are.",

    "text": "Sampling Distribution\n\nDistirbution of the Mean with Finite Population\nUp to this point, we have assumed that samples are drawn from a very large or effectively infinite population. In such cases, the sample represents only a tiny fraction of the population, so the usual standard error formula is appropriate.\nHowever, when the population is finite and the sample makes up a noticeable portion of that population, the standard error of the mean must be adjusted. This situation arises when the ratio of sample size to population size: \\(n/N \\gt 5\\).\nIn these cases, we use the finite population correction factor (FPC) to account for the fact that sampling without replacement reduces variability. The corrected standard error becomes smaller because the sample is capturing a larger portion of the population.\nFor example, if a population contains 100 individuals, and we sample more than 5 of them (i.e., \\(n &gt; 5\\)), the finite population correction factor should be applied to compute an accurate standard error.\nIgnoring the correction would overestimate the sampling error and lead to incorrect probability calculations.\n\\[\n\\sigma_{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\sqrt{\\frac{N - n}{N - 1}}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\sigma:\\) Population standard deviation\n\\(N:\\) Population size\n\\(n:\\) Sample size\n\\(\\frac{N-n}{N-1}:\\) finite population correction factor.\n\nThis adjustment ensures that probability calculations and confidence intervals accurately reflect the reduced sampling variability when the sample is a sizable proportion of the population.\nExample\nConsider a consulting firm serving 120 clients. Historically, the average satisfaction rating is 7.3. A recent survey of 50 clients shows an average of 7.8.\nBecause the sample is more than 5% of the population, the finite population correction must be applied:\n\nThe sample represents a large share of all clients.\nSampling without replacement reduces variability.\nUsing the FPC provides a more accurate standard error.\nA low resulting probability suggests the true population mean has improved.\n\nThis type of adjustment is essential in practical business settings:\n\nsmall customer lists\ninternal employee populations\nspecialized cohorts\n\nEffect of the Correction Factor\nThe following table illustrates how the standard error changes when the population size is 100 and the sample size increases. As \\(n\\) grows, the correction factor becomes smaller, reducing the standard error significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Size (n)\nStandard Error\nFinite Correction Factor\nStandard Error with FPC\n\n\n\n\n40\n0.111\n0.778\n0.086\n\n\n60\n0.090\n0.636\n0.057\n\n\n80\n0.078\n0.449\n0.035\n\n\n100\n0.070\n0\n0\n\n\n\nAs shown, when the sample covers the entire population (\\(n = 100\\)), the corrected standard error becomes zero, as no sampling error exists in a census.\n\n\nDistribution of the Proportion\nIn many real-world applications, we analyze proportions rather than means.\nFor example the % of:\n\ncustomers who churn\nvoters who support a candidate\nhouseholds that watch a specific media event.\n\nIn these situations, the statistic of interest is the sample proportion, and its behavior across repeated samples is described by the sampling distribution of the proportion.\nSuppose a national streaming analytics firm claims that 52% of U.S. households watched a large live sports event in 2024. A media agency wants to verify the claim and surveys 300 randomly selected households. In the sample, 147 households watched the event.\nTo evaluate whether this sample supports the firm’s claim, we check whether the sample size is large enough to use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.\nThe following conditions must hold:\n\\[\nnp \\ge 5\n\\]\n\\[\nn(1 - p) \\ge 5\n\\]\nUsing the claimed proportion \\(p = 0.52\\) and sample size \\(n = 300\\):\n\\[\nnp = 300(0.52) = 156 \\ge 5\n\\]\n\\[\nn(1 - p) = 300(0.48) = 144 \\ge 5\n\\]\nThus, the normal approximation is appropriate.\n\n\nSample Proportion\nThe sample proportion is:\n\\[\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{x}{n}\n\\]\nFor this survey:\n\\[\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{147}{300} = 0.49\n\\]\n\nStandard Error of the Proportion\nThe standard error reflects how much sample proportions vary across repeated samples:\n\\[\n\\sigma_{\\hat{p}} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{p(1 - p)}{n} }\n\\]\n\n\nz-Score for the Sample Proportion\nTo evaluate how far the sample proportion is from the claimed population proportion:\n\\[\nz_{\\hat{p}} = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p}{\\sigma_{\\hat{p}}}\n\\]\nA large positive or negative value indicates that the observed sample proportion would be unlikely if the claimed population proportion were correct.\nThe sampling distribution of the proportion allows us to determine how probable it is to observe a sample proportion like the one in our study. If the probability is small, the sample provides evidence against the population claim. If the probability is reasonable, the sample is consistent with the claim.\nIn this example, the observed sample proportion (0.49) is close to the claimed population proportion (0.52), and with a moderate sample size, the difference is well within the range of expected sampling variability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\nA[\"Population with true proportion p\"] --&gt; B[\"Select a random sample\"]\nB --&gt; C[\"Count successes in the sample\"]\nC --&gt; D[\"Compute the sample proportion\"]\nD --&gt; E[\"Repeat the sampling process\"]\nE --&gt; F[\"Distribution of sample proportions\"]\nF --&gt; G[\"Shape: approximately normal\"]\nF --&gt; H[\"Center equals p\"]\nF --&gt; I[\"Spread depends on p and n\"]",

    "text": "Confidence Intervals\nOne of the most important roles statistics plays in today’s world is to:\n\ngather information from a sample,\nuse that information to make a statement about the population from which the sample was chosen.\n\n\nUnderstanding confidence intervals helps quantify how certain we are about the population parameter based on sample data.\n\n\nPoint Estimates\nA point estimate is a single value that best describes the population parameter of interest.\nThe most common point estimates are:\n\nthe sample mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\))\nthe sample proportion (\\(\\hat{p}\\))\n\n\nPoint estimates are easy to calculate, but they provide no information about the accuracy or uncertainty of the estimate.

To determine this interval, we need two more pieces of information:\n\nthe sample size: \\(\\bar{x}\\)\n\nthe population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\)\n\nSuppose the sample mean was based on the 32 orders (\\(n=32\\)). Also, we’ll assume the population standard deviation is equal to \\(\\sigma=40.602\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAbout known Standard Deviation\n\n\n\nUsually domain experts are familiar with the value of SD\n\n\nStandard Error (SE):\n\\[\n\\sigma_{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{\\$ 40.602}{\\sqrt{32}} = \\$7.173\n\\]\nMargin of Error (MoE):\nA margin of error represents the width of the confidence interval between a sample mean and its upper limit or between a sample mean and its lower limit.

In the example, Sample 1 produced a 90% confidence interval that correctly captured the true population mean of 125. However, Sample 5 produced an interval that entirely missed the true mean.\nThis outcome is expected. A 90% confidence interval means that the method, when applied repeatedly across many random samples of the same size, will produce intervals that contain the population mean about 90% of the time. It does not mean that any individual interval has a 90% chance of containing the true value, nor does it guarantee that 9 out of 10 intervals from a small set of samples will succeed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample\nSample Mean\nMargin of Error\nLower Limit\nUpper Limit\n\n\n\n\n1\n129.20\n11.80\n117.40\n141.00\n\n\n2\n132.00\n11.80\n120.20\n143.80\n\n\n3\n117.50\n11.80\n105.70\n129.30\n\n\n4\n128.20\n11.80\n116.40\n140.00\n\n\n5\n108.80\n11.80\n97.00\n120.60\n\n\n6\n130.10\n11.80\n118.30\n141.90\n\n\n7\n117.90\n11.80\n106.10\n129.70\n\n\n8\n120.10\n11.80\n108.30\n131.90\n\n\n9\n133.80\n11.80\n122.00\n145.60\n\n\n10\n119.00\n11.80\n107.20\n130.80\n\n\n\nThe key idea: confidence intervals describe the long-run performance of the estimation procedure, not certainty about the result of a single sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidence Intervals for the Mean | Unknown SD\nSo far our Confidence Interval examples have assumed that the population standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)), is known. In practice, this is rarely the case. Most of the time, we only have access to the sample itself, and we must estimate the population standard deviation using the sample standard deviation, \\(s\\).\nThe sample standard deviation can always be computed directly from the data:\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n - 1}}\n\\]\nSince \\(s\\) is based on the sample, it is only an estimate of the true population standard deviation. As a result, when \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown, we cannot rely on the normal distribution to calculate a confidence interval for the mean.\nInstead, we use the Student’s t-distribution, which adjusts for the uncertainty created by estimating \\(\\sigma\\) with \\(s\\).\nThe t-distribution behaves like the normal distribution when sample sizes are large, but it has heavier tails for smaller sample sizes. This accounts for the additional variability that comes from estimating the standard deviation. As the sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal distribution.\nThe overall structure of the Confidence Interval formula remains the same:\n\n\\(\\sigma \\Rightarrow s\\)\n\nnormal distribution \\(\\Rightarrow\\) t-distribution\nz-table \\(\\Rightarrow\\) t-tabe\n\nThis adjustment allows us to construct valid confidence intervals in the realistic case where the population standard deviation is not available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteInteresting fact about T-distribution\n\n\n\nPlease watch this video.\n\n\n\nStudent’s t-distribution\n\nA bell-shaped and symmetric, similar to the normal distribution.\nIts exact shape depends on the degrees of freedom, defined as \\(n - 1\\) for a sample of size \\(n\\).\nThe total area under the curve is 1.0, just like any valid probability distribution.\nBecause it is wider and flatter than the normal distribution, the critical values from the t-distribution are larger than z-critical values for the same confidence level. This leads to wider confidence intervals, reflecting the extra uncertainty created by estimating the population standard deviation with the sample standard deviation.\nThe t-distribution is actually a family of distributions one for each degree of freedom.

This gives the approximate standard error:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\bar{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\bar{p}(1 - \\bar{p})}{n}}\n\\]\nAfter calculated the standard error, can calculate the 99% confidence interval for the proportion of female shopping customers using MoE and calculating UCL and LCL.\n\\[\n\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\bar{p}}\n= \\sqrt{\\frac{\\bar{p}(1 - \\bar{p})}{n}}\n= \\sqrt{\\frac{0.663(1 - 0.663)}{175}}\n= \\sqrt{\\frac{0.223}{175}}\n= \\sqrt{0.001274}\n= 0.0357\n\\]\n\\[ \\Downarrow \\]\n\\[\nUCL_{\\bar{p}} = \\bar{p} + z_{\\alpha/2}\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\bar{p}} = 0.663 + (2.575)(0.0357) =  0.755\n\\]\n\\[\nLCL_{\\bar{p}} = \\bar{p} - z_{\\alpha/2}\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\bar{p}} = 0.663 - (2.575)(0.0357) =0.571\n\\]\nBased on our sample proportion of 0.663, we are 99% confident that the proportion of female shoppers is between 0.572  and 0.755,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionWhy is it wider?\n\n\n\nThe confidence interval seems wider as we want to be 99% confident of capturing the population proportion we need a wide interval\n\n\n\n\nDetermining the Required Sample Size\nSo far, we have focused on calculating a confidence interval and margin of error for a population when we know:\n\nThe confidence level\n\nThe sample size\n\nThe standard deviation\n\nNow we will try to reverse the process. Instead of computing the margin of error from the sample size, we determine the sample size needed to achieve a desired margin of error, given:\n\nThe confidence level\n\nThe population standard deviation\n\nThis procedure is extremely useful because one of the first practical questions in statistical work is: How large should the sample be?\n\ntoo large: wastes resources.\n\ntoo small: produces estimates that are not precise enough.\n\nWe will begin by determining the required sample size for estimating a population mean and proportion.\n\nSample Size | Estimating Population Mean\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAt&T Case Study\n\n\n\nA major telecom operator in 2024 needed an accurate estimate of average monthly mobile data usage. With heavy-streaming customers generating most of the traffic, the operator aimed to set plans that balance cost and capacity.\nTo achieve this at a 95% confidence level with a \\(\\pm2\\) GB margin of error, the operator calculated the sample size required to estimate the population mean efficiently and reliably.\nBased on internal analytics, the population standard deviation is believed to be \\(\\sigma = 8\\) GB.\n\n\nIn order to identify the Sample Size we need to do minor algebra for MoE Equation:\n\\[MoE_\\bar{x} = z_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} \\sigma_{\\bar{x}} = z_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\Rightarrow  \\sqrt{n} = \\frac{z_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}\\sigma}{MoE}\\]\n\\[\nn = \\left( \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2}\\, 2\\sigma}{\\text{MoE}} \\right)^2\n\\]\nRemember for a 95% confidence level critical z-value would be \\(z_{\\alpha/2} = 1.96\\)\nCalculate and round up:\n\\[\nn = \\left( \\frac{1.96 \\cdot 8}{2} \\right)^2 = 61.46 = 62\n\\]\nThus, a sample of 62 customers is required to estimate the average monthly mobile data usage with a 95% confidence interval and a \\(\\pm2\\) GB margin of error.\n\n\nSample Size | Estimating Proportion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipFinTech Case Study: Biometric Login Adoption\n\n\n\nA leading FinTech app in 2025 wants to estimate the proportion of users who enable biometric login\n(FaceID/TouchID). This metric is crucial for security-feature adoption and for planning future upgrades.\nTo achieve a 95% confidence level with a \\(\\pm2\\)% margin of error, the company needs to determine the minimum sample size required to estimate this proportion accurately.\nA quick pilot test of 200 users revealed that 24% had biometric login enabled, giving\n\\[\\bar{p} = 0.24\\]\n\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2}^2 \\, \\bar{p}(1 - \\bar{p})}{(MoE_{\\bar{p}})^2}\n\\]\nFor a 95% confidence level, we use:\n\n\\(z_{\\alpha/2} = 1.96\\)\n\\(\\bar{p} = 0.24\\)\n\\(MoE_{\\bar{p}} = 0.02\\)\n\nThus\n\\[\nn \\approx \\frac{(1.96)^2 (0.24)(0.76)}{(0.02)^2} \\approx 1402.6 \\Rightarrow 1403\n\\]\nA sample of 1,403 users is required to estimate the true proportion of biometric-enabled users within\na 95% confidence interval and \\(\\pm2\\) percentage points of precision.",

    "section": "WHERE",
    "text": "WHERE\nWhen conducting an analysis, you will almost never work with every single record in a database. Instead, you will focus on a specific subset of data that is relevant to the business question you are trying to answer.\nIn the context of our case study, this might mean\n\nanalyzing sales made in a particular year,\ntransactions with high discounts,\nproducts belonging to a specific category, or\ncustomers from a certain city.\netc.\n\nTo extract only the records that matter for your analysis, you need to filter the data.\nIn SQL, filtering is primarily done using the WHERE clause. The WHERE clause allows you to include or exclude rows based on conditions applied to columns in your tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor example, you may want to look only at sales where:\n\nthe total sales amount exceeds a certain threshold,\norders placed in a specific quarter\nproducts priced above the average.\n\n\n\nTo define these filtering conditions, the WHERE clause is combined with operators.\nSome of these operators are intuitive and closely resemble everyday language, such as BETWEEN, OR, IN, AND or LIKE.\nBy understanding how these operators work, you can precisely control which rows from tables like sales, orders, products, or customers are included in your analysis.\n\nSimple WHERE Conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJUST a REMINDER\n\n\n\nYou can filter rows based on a single condition.\nExample: select transactions where total sales exceed 100,000.\nSELECT\n    transaction_id,\n    order_date_date,\n    product_name,\n    total_sales\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE total_sales &gt; 1000;\nOnly rows with total_sales greater than 1000 are included in the result.\nExample: select transactions for products in the Electronics category.\nSELECT\n    transaction_id,\n    product_name,\n    category,\n    total_sales\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE category = 'Electronics';\n\n\nCombining Conditions with AND\nThe AND operator requires all conditions to be true for a row to be included.\nExample: select transactions from 2024 with high total sales.\nSELECT\n    transaction_id,\n    order_date_date,\n    year,\n    product_name,\n    total_sales\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE year = 2023\n  AND total_sales &gt; 10000;\nRows must satisfy both conditions at the same time.\nExample: select Electronics sales from the city of East Amanda.\nSELECT\n    transaction_id,\n    city,\n    category,\n    total_sales\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE city = 'East Amanda'\n  AND category = 'Electronics';\n\n\nCombining Conditions with OR\nThe OR operator requires at least one condition to be true.\nExample: select transactions that occurred either in East Amanda or Smithside.\nSELECT\n    transaction_id,\n    order_date_date,\n    city,\n    total_sales\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE city = 'East Amanda'\n   OR city = 'Smithside';\nExample: select transactions for products in either the Toys or Books categories.\nSELECT\n    transaction_id,\n    product_name,\n    category,\n    total_sales\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE category = 'Toys'\n   OR category = 'Books';\n\n\nUsing BETWEEN for Ranges\nThe BETWEEN operator is used to filter values within a specified range.\nThe range is inclusive of both boundary values.\nExample: select transactions with total sales between 50,000 and 150,000.\nSELECT\n    transaction_id,\n    order_date_date,\n    total_sales\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE total_sales BETWEEN 50000 AND 150000;\nExample: select transactions from years between 2022 and 2024.\nSELECT\n    transaction_id,\n    year,\n    total_sales\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE year BETWEEN 2022 AND 2024;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nwe can achieve the same result by doing:\nWHERE year&gt;=2022 and year&lt;2024\n\n\nWhen filtering against a fixed list of known values, the IN and NOT IN operators provide a cleaner and more readable alternative to multiple OR conditions.\n\n\n\nUsing IN\nThe IN operator checks whether a value matches any value in a specified list.\nExample: select transactions from selected cities.\nSELECT\n    transaction_id,\n    city,\n    total_sales\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE city IN ('East Amanda', 'Smithside', 'Lake Thomas');\nThis query is functionally equivalent to combining multiple OR conditions, but is easier to read and maintain.\nExample: select transactions for specific product categories.\nSELECT\n    transaction_id,\n    product_name,\n    category,\n    total_sales\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE category IN ('Electronics', 'Books');\n\n\n\nUsing NOT IN\nThe NOT IN operator excludes rows that match any value in the specified list.\nExample: exclude transactions from specific cities.\nSELECT\n    transaction_id,\n    city,\n    total_sales\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE city NOT IN ('East Lori', 'Anthonymouth');\nExample: exclude low-priority product categories.\nSELECT\n    transaction_id,\n    product_name,\n    category,\n    total_sales\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE category NOT IN ('Toys', 'Books');\n\n\nFiltering Text with LIKE\nThe LIKE operator is used for pattern matching on text columns.\nThe percent sign % represents zero or more characters.\nExample: select products whose name starts with the letter “E”.\nSELECT\n    transaction_id,\n    product_name,\n    category,\n    total_sales\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE product_name LIKE 'E%';\nExample: select cities whose name contains the word “North”.\nSELECT\n    transaction_id,\n    city,\n    total_sales\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE city LIKE '%North%';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLIKE Operator Example\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nWHERE product_name LIKE 'Elec%'\nFinds values that start with “Elec”\n\n\nWHERE product_name LIKE '%Phone'\nFinds values that end with “Phone”\n\n\nWHERE product_name LIKE '%Pro%'\nFinds values that contain “Pro” anywhere\n\n\nWHERE city LIKE '_ast%'\nFinds values with “ast” starting from the second character\n\n\nWHERE city LIKE 'N%_%'\nFinds values that start with “N” and are at least 3 characters\n\n\nWHERE category LIKE 'B%ks'\nFinds values that start with “B” and end with “ks”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningcapitalization\n\n\n\nWhen using the LIKE operator, it is important to pay attention to capitalization. In PostgreSQL, LIKE is case-sensitive by default. This means that searching for a value with different letter casing may return no results.\nFor example, product categories such as Electronics or city names like East Amanda must be matched using the correct capitalization. Searching for 'electronics' or 'east amanda' with LIKE would not return any rows.\nTo handle this, you can normalize the text by converting both the column and the search pattern to the same case using string functions. Common approaches include using LOWER() or UPPER() to make the comparison case-insensitive.\nAlternatively, PostgreSQL provides the ILIKE operator, which performs case-insensitive pattern matching and is often more convenient when working with user-entered text or inconsistent capitalization.\n\n\n\n\nHandling NULL Values Correctly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionIS NULL or NOT NULL\n\n\n\nIn SQL, NULL represents missing or unknown data.\nIt is not equal to anything, including another NULL.\nThis means the following will not work as expected:\nWHERE discount = NULL\nTo correctly filter missing values, always use:\nWHERE discount IS NULL\nTo filter rows where a value exists, use:\nWHERE discount IS NOT NULL\nBe especially careful when using NOT IN.\nIf the list contains a NULL, the condition may return no rows at all.\nWhen working with columns that may contain missing values, consider explicitly handling NULL values before applying IN or NOT IN.",

    "section": "HAVING",
    "text": "HAVING\n\nDetecting Duplicates with HAVING\nIn analytical work, identifying duplicate records is an important data quality task.\nDuplicates can distort metrics, inflate counts, and lead to incorrect conclusions.\nThe HAVING clause combined with COUNT() is commonly used to detect duplicates after grouping.\n\n\n\nIdentifying Duplicate Transactions\nAlthough transaction_id is expected to be unique, this example demonstrates the general technique for detecting duplicates.\nSELECT\n    transaction_id,\n    COUNT(*) AS occurrence_count\nFROM sales_analysis\nGROUP BY transaction_id\nHAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1;\nIf this query returns rows, it indicates duplicated transaction records in the analysis table.\n\n\n\nDetecting Duplicate Product Sales on the Same Date\nThis example checks whether the same product appears multiple times on the same date, which may or may not be expected depending on the business logic.\nSELECT\n    product_name,\n    order_date_date,\n    COUNT(*) AS occurrence_count\nFROM sales_analysis\nGROUP BY product_name, order_date_date\nHAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1\nORDER BY occurrence_count DESC;\nThis helps identify repeated entries for the same product on a given day.\n\n\n\nFinding Customers with Multiple Transactions on the Same Day\nThis analysis identifies customers who made multiple purchases on the same date.\nSELECT\n    customer_name,\n    order_date_date,\n    COUNT(*) AS transaction_count\nFROM sales_analysis\nGROUP BY customer_name, order_date_date\nHAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1\nORDER BY transaction_count DESC;\nThis can reveal bulk purchases, repeat behavior, or potential data duplication.\n\n\n\nIdentifying Potential Duplicate Sales Amounts\nSometimes duplicates appear as identical sales values repeated multiple times.\nSELECT\n    total_sales,\n    order_date_date,\n    COUNT(*) AS occurrence_count\nFROM sales_analysis\nGROUP BY total_sales, order_date_date\nHAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1\nORDER BY occurrence_count DESC;\nThis pattern can signal repeated transactions or data loading issues.\n\n\nRevenue-Focused Analysis\nThis example focuses on identifying product categories that generated significant revenue during a specific period.\nSELECT\n    category,\n    SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales_amount\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE year = 2023\nGROUP BY category\nHAVING SUM(total_sales) &gt; 500000\nORDER BY total_sales_amount DESC;\nThis analysis highlights the strongest revenue-driving categories for the year and filters out categories with marginal impact.\n\n\n\nTransaction Volume Analysis by City\nHere, the focus is on understanding customer activity levels across different cities.\nSELECT\n    city,\n    COUNT(transaction_id) AS transaction_count\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE year = 2023\nGROUP BY city\nHAVING COUNT(transaction_id) &gt; 1000\nORDER BY transaction_count DESC;\nThis helps identify cities with consistently high transaction volumes.\n\n\n\nRevenue Performance by City\nTransaction volume alone does not fully describe performance. This example focuses on revenue contribution by city.\nSELECT\n    city,\n    SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales_amount\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE year = 2023\nGROUP BY city\nHAVING SUM(total_sales) &gt; 400000\nORDER BY total_sales_amount DESC;\nThis distinguishes cities that generate substantial revenue from those driven primarily by transaction count.\n\n\n\nHigh-Frequency, Low-Revenue Categories\nThis analysis helps detect categories that sell often but contribute relatively little to total revenue.\nSELECT\n    category,\n    COUNT(transaction_id) AS transaction_count,\n    SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales_amount\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE year = 2023\nGROUP BY category\nHAVING COUNT(transaction_id) &gt; 500\n   AND SUM(total_sales) &lt; 300000\nORDER BY transaction_count DESC;\nSuch patterns may indicate lower-priced items or aggressive discounting strategies.\n\n\n\nAverage Transaction Value by City\nInstead of total revenue, this example focuses on transaction quality.\nSELECT\n    city,\n    AVG(total_sales) AS avg_transaction_value\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE year = 2023\nGROUP BY city\nHAVING AVG(total_sales) &gt; 800\nORDER BY avg_transaction_value DESC;\nThis highlights markets where customers tend to make higher-value purchases.\n\n\n\nRevenue with Controlled Discounting\nThis analysis combines revenue performance with pricing discipline.\nSELECT\n    category,\n    SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales_amount,\n    AVG(discount) AS avg_discount\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE year = 2023\nGROUP BY category\nHAVING SUM(total_sales) &gt; 400000\n   AND AVG(discount) &lt; 0.15\nORDER BY total_sales_amount DESC;\nThis helps identify categories that perform well financially without relying heavily on discounts.\n\n\nUsing HAVING Instead of WHERE — Common Interview Trap\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is possible to filter by non-aggregated columns (such as category or city) using the HAVING clause if those columns appear in the GROUP BY clause.\nFor example, this query is syntactically valid:\nSELECT\n    category,\n    SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales_amount\nFROM sales_analysis\nGROUP BY category\nHAVING category = 'Electronics';\nHowever, this is not equivalent in intent or best practice to using WHERE.\nThe preferred and correct approach is:\nSELECT\n    category,\n    SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales_amount\nFROM sales_analysis\nWHERE category = 'Electronics'\nGROUP BY category;\n\nWill the results be the same?\nYes — in this specific case, the final result will be the same.\nBut the execution logic is different:\n\nWHERE filters rows before aggregation\nHAVING filters groups after aggregation\n\nUsing HAVING to filter non-aggregated columns means:\n\nMore rows are processed than necessary\nAggregation work is done first, then filtered\nPerformance may be worse on large datasets\n\n\n\nInterview takeaway\n\nFiltering raw columns → use WHERE\nFiltering aggregated results → use HAVING\nUsing HAVING instead of WHERE for column filters is usually a code smell, even if it returns the same result\n\nInterviewers often ask this to test whether you understand query execution order, not just syntax.",

Conceptually, it works very similarly to everyday logic:\n\nIf a condition is true, return one value\nIf another condition is true, return a different value\nOtherwise, return a default value\n\nIn SQL, this logic is expressed using WHEN, THEN, ELSE, and END.\n\n\nBasic Structure of CASE\nThe general structure of a CASE statement looks like this:\nCASE\n    WHEN condition_1 THEN result_1\n    WHEN condition_2 THEN result_2\n    ELSE default_result\nEND\nThe CASE statement is typically written inside the SELECT clause and creates a new derived column in the query result.\n\n\n\nCategorizing Transactions by Sales Size\nExample: classify each transaction based on its total sales amount.\nSELECT\n    transaction_id,\n    total_sales,\n    CASE\n        WHEN total_sales &gt;= 100000 THEN 'High Value'\n        WHEN total_sales &gt;= 50000 THEN 'Medium Value'\n        ELSE 'Low Value'\n    END AS sales_segment\nFROM sales_analysis;\nThis query creates a new column called sales_segment that categorizes each transaction based on business-defined thresholds.\n\n\n\nCreating Customer-Facing Labels\nExample: label transactions based on discount behavior.\nSELECT\n    transaction_id,\n    discount,\n    CASE\n        WHEN discount IS NULL THEN 'No Discount Information'\n        WHEN discount = 0 THEN 'No Discount'\n        WHEN discount &lt;= 0.10 THEN 'Low Discount'\n        ELSE 'High Discount'\n    END AS discount_category\nFROM sales_analysis;\nThis is useful when translating raw numeric values into interpretable categories.\n\n\nCategorizing Products by Price Range\nExample: group products into pricing tiers.\nSELECT\n    product_name,\n    price,\n    CASE\n        WHEN price &gt;= 1000 THEN 'Premium'\n        WHEN price &gt;= 500 THEN 'Mid-Range'\n        ELSE 'Budget'\n    END AS price_category\nFROM sales_analysis;\nThis type of logic is frequently used in reporting and segmentation.\n\n\nCASE with Dates and Time-Based Logic\nExample: label transactions as early or late in the year.\nSELECT\n    transaction_id,\n    order_date_date,\n    CASE\n        WHEN quarter IN (1, 2) THEN 'First Half'\n        ELSE 'Second Half'\n    END AS year_period\nFROM sales_analysis;\nThis helps simplify time-based analysis without modifying the underlying table.\n\n\n\nCASE with Aggregation\nCASE can also be combined with aggregation to create conditional metrics.\nExample: calculate total sales for discounted vs non-discounted transactions.\nSELECT\n    CASE\n        WHEN discount &gt; 0 THEN 'Discounted'\n        ELSE 'Full Price'\n    END AS pricing_type,\n    SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales_amount\nFROM sales_analysis\nGROUP BY pricing_type;\nHere, the CASE expression defines the grouping logic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipImportant Note About CASE\n\n\n\nA CASE statement creates a derived column only in the query result.\nIt does not create or modify columns in the underlying database table.\nIf you need to store the result permanently, you must use CREATE TABLE AS or ALTER TABLE with an update statement.",

DOUBLE PRECISION) may introduce rounding differences.\n\n\n\n\nPerformance vs Precision Trade-off\nWhen choosing a numeric data type, you must balance precision, performance, and storage efficiency.\nThe table below summarizes the most common analytical requirements and the recommended PostgreSQL data types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirement\nPrecision Needed\nPerformance

built on:\n\nIndex on INTEGER \\(\\rightarrow\\) small \\(\\rightarrow\\) cache-friendly\nIndex on NUMERIC \\(\\rightarrow\\) larger \\(\\rightarrow\\) slower to scan\nComposite indexes amplify the effect of column size\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantBest Practice\n\n\n\nUse the smallest numeric type that safely fits your data.\n\nPrefer INTEGER over BIGINT if values fit\nUse NUMERIC only when precision matters\nAvoid premature use of NUMERIC for IDs or counters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacter Data Types\nCharacter data types are used to store textual information such as names, descriptions, identifiers, and free-form text.\nIn PostgreSQL, character data types fall into three main groups:\n\nFixed-length characters — text with a fixed size\n\nVariable-length characters — text with flexible size limits\n\nUnbounded text — long or unpredictable text\n\nCharacter data types are used for:\n\nnames\ndescriptions\nemails\ncodes\ncomments\n\n\nMain Character Data

CHAR(n) \\(\\rightarrow\\) predictable size \\(\\rightarrow\\) stable performance\nIndex on VARCHAR(n) \\(\\rightarrow\\) variable size \\(\\rightarrow\\) generally efficient\nIndex on TEXT \\(\\rightarrow\\) potentially large \\(\\rightarrow\\) slower scans for long values\nLong strings in composite indexes increase index size significantly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantBest Practice\n\n\n\nUse constraints, not oversized text types, to control data quality.\n\nPrefer VARCHAR(n) when a reasonable maximum length exists\nUse TEXT for descriptions and comments\nAvoid CHAR(n) unless values are truly fixed-length\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate & Time Data Types\nDate and time data types are used to store temporal information, such as when an event occurred, started, or ended.\nThey are critical for analytics involving time series, trends, seasonality, and durations.\nIn PostgreSQL, date and time data types fall into four main groups:\n\nDate-only values\nTime-only values\nTimestamps (date + time)\nTime intervals / durations\n\nDate & time data types are used for:\n\nevent dates\ntimestamps\nlog records\ndurations\ntime-based analysis\n\n\nMain Date & Time Data

internally and displays them using the session time zone.\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy vs Interpretability Trade-off\nWhen working with time data, the trade-off is often between absolute correctness and human interpretation.\n\n\n\nRequirement\nTime Zone Awareness\nRecommended Data Type\n\n\n\n\nSimple dates\nNot needed\nDATE\n\n\nLocal business timestamps\nNot required\nTIMESTAMP\n\n\nMulti-region systems\nRequired\nTIMESTAMPTZ\n\n\nDurations and differences\nNot applicable\nINTERVAL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex Size Considerations\nDate and time types are fixed-size, making them efficient for indexing:\n\nIndex on DATE \\(\\rightarrow\\) small \\(\\rightarrow\\) very fast range scans\nIndex on TIMESTAMP \\(\\rightarrow\\) small \\(\\rightarrow\\) efficient sorting\nIndex on TIMESTAMPTZ \\(\\rightarrow\\) small \\(\\rightarrow\\) timezone-safe\nIndex on INTERVAL \\(\\rightarrow\\) rarely indexed (use carefully)\n\nDate-based indexes are commonly used with:\n\nWHERE date BETWEEN …\nGROUP BY date\ntime-window queries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantBest Practice\n\n\n\nAlways use TIMESTAMPTZ for analytics and logging systems.\n\nAvoid ambiguity in multi-region environments\nUse DATE only when time is irrelevant\nStore durations as INTERVAL, not numeric hacks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoolean & Categorical Data Types\nBoolean and categorical data types are used to store logical values and finite categories.\nThey are especially important for filtering, segmentation, and business rules.\nIn PostgreSQL, boolean and categorical data types fall into two main groups:\n\nBoolean values — true / false logic\n\nCategorical values — limited sets of labels\n\nThese data types are used for:\n\nflags\nstatus indicators\nbinary decisions\ncategorical segmentation\n\n\nMain Boolean & Categorical Data Types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Type\nDescription\nExample Value\nMemory Size\nTypical Use Case\n\n\n\n\nBOOLEAN\nLogical true / false value\nTRUE, FALSE\n1 byte\nActive flags,

segments\n\n\nTEXT\nFree-form category label\n‘high_value_customer’\nVariable\nTags, labels\n\n\nENUM\nPredefined set of values\n(‘low’,‘medium’,‘high’)\n4 bytes\nControlled categories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nPostgreSQL accepts multiple boolean literals:\nTRUE / FALSE, true / false, 1 / 0, yes / no.\n\n\n\n\nControl vs Flexibility Trade-off\nThe main trade-off for categorical data is between data integrity and flexibility.\n\n\n\nRequirement\nValidation Strictness\nRecommended Data Type\n\n\n\n\nBinary logic\nVery strict\nBOOLEAN\n\n\nSmall fixed category set\nVery strict\nENUM\n\n\nEvolving categories\nMedium\nVARCHAR(n)\n\n\nUser-defined labels\nLow\nTEXT\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex Size Considerations\n\nIndex on BOOLEAN \\(\\rightarrow\\) very small \\(\\rightarrow\\) fast but often low selectivity\nIndex on short categorical strings \\(\\rightarrow\\) efficient\nIndex on high-cardinality categories \\(\\rightarrow\\) more useful than boolean indexes\nAvoid indexing columns with very few distinct values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantBest Practice\n\n\n\nUse BOOLEAN only for true binary logic.\n\nDo not encode booleans as ‘Y’/‘N’ unless required\nUse ENUM only when categories are stable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial & Advanced Data Types | OPTIONAL\nBeyond standard numeric, text, and date types, PostgreSQL supports specialized data types designed for specific domains such as\n\ngeospatial analysis\nnetworks\ngraphsand\nsemi-structured data.\n\nThese data types are typically used in advanced analytics, telecom, log analysis, and platform-scale systems.\nSpecial data types are used for:\n\ngeospatial analytics\nnetwork analysis\nsemi-structured data\nsystem-level identifiers\nadvanced domain modeling\n\n\nMain Special Data

    "text": "Constraints\nI used the constraints above the lecture note, and decided to do a deep dive here as well :)\nIn this section, you’ll be looking at constraints, which play a crucial role in keeping your data organized.\nConstraints specify what type of data a table or column can accept, and they are typically set when a table is created. When defined correctly, constraints:\n\nenforce data integrity\n\nprevent invalid or inconsistent data\n\nact as built-in data quality checks\n\nBelow are the most common constraints you will encounter when designing relational databases.\n\nUNIQUE Constraint\nThe UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are distinct.\nIt is commonly used to prevent duplicate records for attributes that must be unique across entities.\nTypical use cases include:\n\nemail addresses\nusernames\nnational identification numbers\n\nExample: ensure each customer email is unique.\nCREATE TABLE customers (\n  customer_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n  email TEXT UNIQUE,\n  phone_number TEXT\n);\nWith this constraint in place, PostgreSQL will reject any attempt to insert a duplicate email address.\n\n\nNOT NULL Constraint\nThe NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column cannot contain empty (NULL) values.\nUse this constraint for fields that are mandatory and must always be provided.\nTypical use cases include:\n\nprimary identifiers\ncontact information\ntransaction timestamps\n\nExample: ensure every customer has a phone number.\nCREATE TABLE customers (\n  customer_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n  phone_number TEXT NOT NULL,\n  email TEXT\n);\nIf an insert is attempted without a phone number, PostgreSQL will return an error.\n\n\nPRIMARY KEY Constraint\nA PRIMARY KEY uniquely identifies each row in a table.\nA primary key:\n\nmust be unique\ncannot contain NULL values\nexists only once per table\n\nExample: define a primary key for a products table.\nCREATE TABLE products (\n  product_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n  product_name TEXT NOT NULL,\n  price NUMERIC(10, 2)\n);\nThe PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically enforces both UNIQUE and NOT NULL.\n\n\nFOREIGN KEY Constraint\nA FOREIGN KEY creates a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table.\nIt ensures referential integrity, meaning that referenced values must exist in the parent table.\nExample: link sales records to customers.\nCREATE TABLE sales (\n  transaction_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n  customer_id INTEGER,\n  total_sales NUMERIC(10, 2),\n  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)\n    REFERENCES customers (customer_id)\n);\nWith this constraint, you cannot insert a sale for a customer that does not exist in the customers table.\n\n\nCHECK Constraint\nThe CHECK constraint restricts the range or condition of values that can be inserted into a column.\nIt validates data based on logical expressions.\nTypical use cases include:\n\nvalue ranges\nminimum or maximum limits\ndomain rules\n\nExample: ensure total sales values are non-negative.\nCREATE TABLE sales (\n  transaction_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n  total_sales NUMERIC(10, 2) CHECK (total_sales &gt;= 0)\n);\nIf a value violates the condition, the insert or update will fail with an error.",

As you gain hands-on experience, you will naturally pick up additional techniques and conventions.\n\nNumbers and Underscores\nIn a relational database:\n\nTable names and column names cannot start with a number\nThey cannot contain spaces\nUse underscores (_) to separate words\n\nThis improves compatibility and readability.\nRecommended\nCREATE TABLE customer_lifecycle;\nCREATE TABLE customer;\nNot Recommended\nCREATE TABLE customer lifecycle;\nCREATE TABLE 3customer;\n\n\nCapitalization\nA widely accepted convention is:\n\nSQL keywords → UPPERCASE\nTable names → lowercase\nColumn names → lowercase\n\nThis makes queries easier to scan and understand.\nRecommended\nSELECT product_id, product_name\nFROM products;\nSELECT transaction_id, total_sales\nFROM sales;\nNot Recommended\nSelect PRODUCT_ID, PRODUCT_NAME From PRODUCTS;\nSELECT TRANSACTION_ID, TOTAL_SALES FROM SALES;\n\n\nCommenting\nIt is good practice to comment your SQL code so that other analysts and developers can easily read and understand your queries.\nComments do not affect query execution—they exist purely for documentation and readability.\nUse -- for single-line comments.\n-- select and display the first 10 rows from the sales table\nSELECT *\nFROM sales\nLIMIT 10;\nMulti-line comments can also be used to temporarily disable blocks of SQL code during testing or debugging.\n/*\nSELECT\n  s.transaction_id,\n  p.product_name,\n  s.total_sales\nFROM sales s\nJOIN products p\n  ON s.product_id = p.product_id\nWHERE s.total_sales &gt; 100;\n*/\n\n\nAliasing\nAliases assign temporary names to columns or tables within a query.\nThey are especially useful for:\n\nimproving readability\nshortening long names\nresolving ambiguity in joins\n\nColumn aliases rename columns in the query output.\nSELECT\n  product_name AS item_name,\n  price AS unit_price\nFROM products;\nTable aliases are commonly used in joins.\nSELECT\n  s.transaction_id,\n  p.product_name,\n  s.total_sales\nFROM sales AS s\nJOIN products AS p\n  ON s.product_id = p.product_id;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nHere you will find much more tips",

Tufte is an American statistician, artist, and former Yale professor, often called the father of data visualization.\nHe argues that visual storytelling should combine:\n\nTruth – no distortion of data\n\nClarity – no unnecessary complexity\n\nDesign integrity – every element has a purpose\n\nHis most influential books include:\n\nThe Visual Display of Quantitative Information\n\nEnvisioning Information\n\nBeautiful Evidence\n\nTufte’s principles are not about decoration but purposeful simplicity — every mark, color, or shape should tell part of the story.",
